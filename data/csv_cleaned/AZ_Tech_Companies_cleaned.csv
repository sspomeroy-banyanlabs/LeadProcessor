When you work with us, it’s all about YOU. At IT Partners, your business goals and initiatives are what define our engagement. We believe that every organization should have a Hybrid Architecture that they can call their own.
•	Our conversations aren’t typical—We strive to learn about your business rather than just talking technology
•	We are architecture driven—Our mantra is to lead with architecture first, and then integrate technology
•	Strong partnerships—Architecture defines what you should do, but our partnerships enable us to make it a reality
•	We’ve been in your shoes—Many members of our team have been leaders and decision makers in IT organizations
Let’s discuss how you’re being challenged to deliver services today, how you’d like to be able to respond in the future, and whiteboard what a Hybrid Architecture could look like in your organization.

Let us help you build one that’s unequivocally yours.

With a highly custom Hybrid Architecture, we can help your organization take advantage of the right technology to improve how you deliver IT services to your end users.

As organizations like yours strive for a sustainable competitive advantage, we empower you with the tools to make better business decisions. Data creates information, but information requires context to become intelligence.

That's why our credo is simple: Driving Better Business through Actionable Intelligence.

 We have been an SAP partner for over 10 years, but Column5’s relationship with SAP runs even deeper than that. Column5 was founded by the thought leaders from OutlookSoft, the company and platform that was acquired by SAP and became what is now SAP BPC. Members of our team are actively involved in the ongoing development and testing of SAP EPM solutions, including all versions of BPC and SAC. Behind-the-scenes knowledge and insights give Column5 and its clients an almost unfair advantage in the world of EPM—especially within the SAP family of products, where we have an eye for seeing that which others in the space often miss. Amidst a sea of data, 

Column5 will help your organization develop the best ways to collect, store, consolidate, and filter it—as well as configure the KPIs, dashboards, and reports that transform it into actionable intelligence. We give your data meaning and context. We make sure your organization has the right data at the right time. And above all, we ensure that you can measure, assess, and improve both your process and performance while reducing risk, decreasing costs, and improving revenue. 

Column 5 numerous certifications, awards, and accolades, including our current SAP Gold Partner status. The title that means the most to us, though, is that of trusted adviser to our customers.

Our employees (see: Parchies) are not only start-up minded, but also willing to invest their talents to build & scale the first-ever digital credential service.  In short, we hire mensches – which are “people with integrity and honor”, for those who don’t speak Yiddish.

At any given time, you may find these mensches:
-Joining the Tuesday all-company meetings, cleverly titled “Every Tuesday.” Here, executives share wins & other key updates that affect the business.  If you’re not at our HQ, join our remote employees & 4 other offices via live video.  We are a tech company after all.
-Submitting a FTGAPI  That stands for “Find the Good and Praise it.” Parchies recognize one another for a job well done on a weekly basis and then they’re shared by our Executives during Every Tuesday meetings.
-Completing their quarterly 5-5-4, our internal Net Promoter Score that measures Parchies’ attitudes toward the company. We ask five questions of each employee, 5 questions of each manager, 4 times per year.  And we take this very seriously. We want to make Parchment a best place to work.
-Meeting 1:1 with our CEO. He has an open door policy & wants to hear from every Parchie. Turns out, there are such things as bad ideas.  But we still want to hear them.
-Empowering each other. A women’s group was established to help the women of Parchment become architects of change in education technology. The group is appropriately titled ParchSHE & meets monthly.
-Coming together for lunch each Friday. A company who eats together, stays together.  Parchment orders in lunch each week to celebrate the great accomplishments of the week.  And if it was a bad week, we bring in soup.

We are always searching for people that are looking for more than a job, but a signature career experience.

Our employees (see: Parchies) are not only start-up minded, but also willing to invest their talents to build & scale the first-ever digital credential service.  In short, we hire mensches – which are “people with integrity and honor”, for those who don’t speak Yiddish.

At any given time, you may find these mensches:
-Joining the Tuesday all-company meetings, cleverly titled “Every Tuesday.” Here, executives share wins & other key updates that affect the business.  If you’re not at our HQ, join our remote employees & 4 other offices via live video.  We are a tech company after all.
-Submitting a FTGAPI  That stands for “Find the Good and Praise it.” Parchies recognize one another for a job well done on a weekly basis and then they’re shared by our Executives during Every Tuesday meetings.
-Completing their quarterly 5-5-4, our internal Net Promoter Score that measures Parchies’ attitudes toward the company. We ask five questions of each employee, 5 questions of each manager, 4 times per year.  And we take this very seriously. We want to make Parchment a best place to work.
-Meeting 1:1 with our CEO. He has an open door policy & wants to hear from every Parchie. Turns out, there are such things as bad ideas.  But we still want to hear them.
-Empowering each other. A women’s group was established to help the women of Parchment become architects of change in education technology. The group is appropriately titled ParchSHE & meets monthly.
-Coming together for lunch each Friday. A company who eats together, stays together.  Parchment orders in lunch each week to celebrate the great accomplishments of the week.  And if it was a bad week, we bring in soup.

We are always searching for people that are looking for more than a job, but a signature career experience.

-Empowering each other. A women’s group was established to help the women of Parchment become architects of change in education technology. The group is appropriately titled ParchSHE & meets monthly.
-Coming together for lunch each Friday. A company who eats together, stays together.  Parchment orders in lunch each week to celebrate the great accomplishments of the week.  And if it was a bad week, we bring in soup.

We are always searching for people that are looking for more than a job, but a signature career experience.  We believe we’re onto something great here & we’re thrilled by anyone who wants to build Parchment with us.  Apply to be a Parchie today.",Computer Software,https://www.linkedin.com/company/114920,$5M-$20M,51,51-200 employees,http://www.moat.com/advertiser/Parchment%20Inc.,http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/www.parchment.com,https://www.google.com/#q=Parchment%20Inc.&tbm=nws,"http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Parchment%20Inc.-reviews-SRCH_KE0,14.htm",http://www.google.com/finance?q=Parchment%20Inc.,https://www.google.com/search?q=Jerome%20Snell%20Parchment%20Inc.,http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Parchment%20Inc.&locT=&locId=&jobType=all,https://www.google.com/search?q=Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona+sports+teams,https://www.google.com/search?q=Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona+weather,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Parchment%20Inc.&as_qdr=all&num=100&meta=&filter=0,http://www.semrush.com/info/www.parchment.com,http://www.keywordspy.com/research/search.aspx?q=www.parchment.com&tab=domain-overview,http://www.ispionage.com/research/US/www.parchment.com,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Parchment%20Inc.&owner=exclude&action=getcompany,https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/subdomains?target=www.parchment.com,https://www.similarsitesearch.com/search/?URL=www.parchment.com,http://socialmention.com/search?q=www.parchment.com&t=all&btnG=Search,http://www.social-searcher.com/social-buzz/?q5=www.parchment.com,http://www.icerocket.com/search?q=Jerome%20Snell,https://twitter.com/search?q=Parchment%20Inc.&vertical=default&f=tweets,http://www.builtwith.com/www.parchment.com,http://www.similarweb.com/website/www.parchment.com,https://www.woorank.com/en/www/www.parchment.com,https://website.grader.com/tests/www.parchment.com,http://www.whois.com/whois/www.parchment.com,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment%20Inc.,http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=Parchment%20Inc.,,,,,,,AZ_Tech_Companies
