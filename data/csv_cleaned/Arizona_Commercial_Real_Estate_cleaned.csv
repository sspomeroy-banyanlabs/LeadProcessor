We locally service loans for our correspondent lenders, who include some of the nation’s largest life companies/ pension funds.  We are part of REFA, a national network of independent commercial  mortgage bankers.

We arrange apartment agency and bridge loans through Hunt Mortgage Group.  

As the Arizona correspondent  for Freedom Financial Funds,  we arrange private customized financing solutions that can close in 3 weeks with no appraisals, on loans from $2 to $15 million.  

Our team has significant  experience as lenders, which allow us to successfully structure optimal financing for our clients.  Integrity and reliability are the foundation upon which we have built our reputation.  

Perhaps this is best demonstrated in the words of a recent customer; ""We just closed a 40.5 million dollar loan that I know would not have happened without Churchill.  Never in my 25 year experience have I met an organization that did all the work necessary to simply “Make It Happen”.

I have also come to know through the years that great companies have great leaders who inspire great people.  Cindy Hammond is one of those.  She knows the meaning of work.
