Educate! provides youth with skills training in leadership, entrepreneurship and workforce readiness along with mentorship to start real businesses at school. Our model is delivered through practically-trained teachers and youth mentors. Educate!’s goal is to make this practical, skills-based model part of national education systems.

In 2016, we worked in 100 schools in Rwanda and 397 secondary schools in Uganda, reaching over 240,000 students. Our model was proven to have massive impact in a randomized controlled trial. Graduates earned DOUBLE the income of a control group and had a 64% increase in business creation. Our graduates change their lives and their communities, such as Lillian Aero who employs over 100 AIDS-affected women.

In 2012, Educate! partnered with Uganda’s government to integrate curriculum and a student business club structure into Uganda's entrepreneurship course nationally, and in 2015 we began serving as a technical advisor to Rwanda on their national curriculum reform.

Educate!’s team includes 100 staff and over 140 volunteer youth mentors. We have been backed by top foundations such as MasterCard, Big Bang Philanthropy, Mulago, Echoing Green, Ashoka and Global Innovation Fund. Educate! won the 2015 WISE Awards, and was featured by Forbes 30 under 30, Clinton Global Initiative and The Brookings Institution.

Educate!'s Vision for 2024 is to measurably impact 1 million students, and reach 4 million students more broadly, across Africa each year.",Nonprofit Organization Management,https://www.linkedin.com/company/713545,$5M-$20M,198.0,51-200 employees,http://www.moat.com/advertiser/Educate!,http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/experienceeducate.org,https://www.google.com/#q=Educate!&tbm=nws,"http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Educate!-reviews-SRCH_KE0,8.htm",http://www.google.com/finance?q=Educate!,https://www.google.com/search?q=Daniel%20Munga%20Educate!,http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Educate!&locT=&locId=&jobType=all,https://www.google.com/search?q=Denver%2C%20Colorado+sports+teams,https://www.google.com/search?q=Denver%2C%20Colorado+weather,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Educate!&as_qdr=all&num=100&meta=&filter=0,http://www.semrush.com/info/experienceeducate.org,http://www.keywordspy.com/research/search.aspx?q=experienceeducate.org&tab=domain-overview,http://www.ispionage.com/research/US/experienceeducate.org,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Educate!&owner=exclude&action=getcompany,https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/subdomains?target=experienceeducate.org,https://www.similarsitesearch.com/search/?URL=experienceeducate.org,http://socialmention.com/search?q=experienceeducate.org&t=all&btnG=Search,http://www.social-searcher.com/social-buzz/?q5=experienceeducate.org,http://www.icerocket.com/search?q=Daniel%20Munga,https://twitter.com/search?q=Educate!&vertical=default&f=tweets,http://www.builtwith.com/experienceeducate.org,http://www.similarweb.com/website/experienceeducate.org,https://www.woorank.com/en/www/experienceeducate.org,https://website.grader.com/tests/experienceeducate.org,http://www.whois.com/whois/experienceeducate.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educate!,http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=Educate!,,,,,,,Colorado_Non_Profits

Educate! provides youth with skills training in leadership, entrepreneurship and workforce readiness along with mentorship to start real businesses at school. Our model is delivered through practically-trained teachers and youth mentors. Educate!’s goal is to make this practical, skills-based model part of national education systems.

In 2016, we worked in 100 schools in Rwanda and 397 secondary schools in Uganda, reaching over 240,000 students. Our model was proven to have massive impact in a randomized controlled trial. Graduates earned DOUBLE the income of a control group and had a 64% increase in business creation. Our graduates change their lives and their communities, such as Lillian Aero who employs over 100 AIDS-affected women.

In 2012, Educate! partnered with Uganda’s government to integrate curriculum and a student business club structure into Uganda's entrepreneurship course nationally, and in 2015 we began serving as a technical advisor to Rwanda on their national curriculum reform.

Educate!’s team includes 100 staff and over 140 volunteer youth mentors. We have been backed by top foundations such as MasterCard, Big Bang Philanthropy, Mulago, Echoing Green, Ashoka and Global Innovation Fund. Educate! won the 2015 WISE Awards, and was featured by Forbes 30 under 30, Clinton Global Initiative and The Brookings Institution.

We believe each and every child deserves access to quality, education, nutrition, shelter, and medical care.

Angel Covers promotes a safe and healthy environment that allows children to grow and become independent, empowered adults who break the cycle of poverty for future generations.


CORE VALUES

Education:  Angel Covers is committed to establishing a strong foundation for lifelong education.  We believe that enabling children to achieve their academic potential will help break the cycle of poverty and allow them to lead healthier, more productive lives.

Nutrition:  Angel Covers provides nutritional programs to help orphaned and impoverished children have basic food and vitamins that supports a child’s overall well-being.  Our goal is to design appropriate nutritional programs that can evolve into self-sustaining projects tailored to meet the needs of the children in each environment.

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children. Thanks to the dedication of thousands of volunteers nationwide, two to three cargo containers of life-saving aid leave Project C.U.R.E.’s warehouses every week.

Our mission is to educate senior decision-makers in business, government and civil society about the principles of sustainability. Natural Capitalism Solutions shows how to restore and further enhance natural and human capital while increasing prosperity and quality of life. In partnership with leading thinkers and groups, Natural Capitalism Solutions creates innovative, practical tools and implementation strategies for companies, communities and countries. Natural Capitalism Solutions (NCS) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

The principles used by Natural Capitalism Solutions are:

1. Buy time by using resources dramatically more productively.
This slows resource depletion, lessens pollution, and increases employment in meaningful jobs. It lowers costs for business and society, halts the degradation of the biosphere, makes it more profitable to employ people, and preserves vital living systems and social cohesion.

2. Redesign industrial processes and the delivery of products and services to do business as nature does, using such approaches as biomimicry and cradle to cradle.
This approach enables a wide array of materials to be produced with low energy flows, in processes that run on sunlight, emulating natures genius.  It shifts to circular economies in which materials are reused, remanufactured and waste is eliminated.

3. Manage all institutions to be restorative of natural and human capital.
Such approaches enhance human well-being and enable the biosphere to produce more wealth from its intact communities and abundant ecosystem services and natural resources.",Nonprofit Organization Management,https://www.linkedin.com/company/849908,$100K-$1M,10.0,2-10 employees,http://www.moat.com/advertiser/Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions,http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/natcapsolutions.org,https://www.google.com/#q=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions&tbm=nws,"http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions-reviews-SRCH_KE0,28.htm",http://www.google.com/finance?q=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions,https://www.google.com/search?q=Christopher%20Juniper%20Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions,http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions&locT=&locId=&jobType=all,https://www.google.com/search?q=Longmont%2C%20Colorado+sports+teams,https://www.google.com/search?q=Longmont%2C%20Colorado+weather,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions&as_qdr=all&num=100&meta=&filter=0,http://www.semrush.com/info/natcapsolutions.org,http://www.keywordspy.com/research/search.aspx?q=natcapsolutions.org&tab=domain-overview,http://www.ispionage.com/research/US/natcapsolutions.org,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions&owner=exclude&action=getcompany,https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/subdomains?target=natcapsolutions.org,https://www.similarsitesearch.com/search/?URL=natcapsolutions.org,http://socialmention.com/search?q=natcapsolutions.org&t=all&btnG=Search,http://www.social-searcher.com/social-buzz/?q5=natcapsolutions.org,http://www.icerocket.com/search?q=Christopher%20Juniper,https://twitter.com/search?q=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions&vertical=default&f=tweets,http://www.builtwith.com/natcapsolutions.org,http://www.similarweb.com/website/natcapsolutions.org,https://www.woorank.com/en/www/natcapsolutions.org,https://website.grader.com/tests/natcapsolutions.org,http://www.whois.com/whois/natcapsolutions.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions,http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions,,,,,,,Colorado_Non_Profits

CHP is supported entirely by donations from private individuals, foundations, and over 40 Episcopal churches in Colorado. Our primary mission is with the Episcopal Mission of St. Paul's, where we work in collaboration with the Priest-in-Charge, Father Abiade Lozama and community members, to help provide education, vocational training, health care, nutrition and clean water within the mission setting.

Haiti: In Petit Trou, the Colorado Haiti Project works to build relationships that cultivate community development that empowers individuals and is locally driven. Our work supports the vision of our Haitian sisters and brothers in building lives of dignity and economic self-sufficiency. Our education and vocational opportunities are vital to the long-term success of this community. While our work in clean water and community health promotes decentralization by building  permanently integrated infrastructure in and around the community of Petit Trou de Nippes, Haiti.

Colorado:  Throughout Colorado, we actively raise awareness and mobilize resources to support and sustain programs in Haiti.  We are committed to providing local opportunities for interactive growth that fosters relationship development and recognizes the rights and capabilities of our Haitian sisters and brothers.

OUR MISSION
We enhance quality of life for people affected by neurological challenges by uniting and empowering our members through a common passion for the outdoors

HOW WE DO IT
OM Community
Our community is available for anyone that shares our passion for the outdoors and has been affected by a neurological challenge (including diagnosed individuals and their supporters). Common neurological challenges include: Epilepsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Brain Tumors, Parkinsons, ALS, Stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury, and more.

OM Connect
Provides members an opportunity to connect one-on-one with another member who has experience with a similar diagnosis and a shared passion for the outdoors.

OM Meetups
Strengthens connections and empowers our members to get outside with others in their local area.

WHY WE DO IT
Our Story
In 2010, thirteen individuals came together inspired by a mutual friend’s determination to make something positive come from a recent diagnosis of a brain tumor. Everyone shared a link to a neurological challenge (brain tumors, aneurysms, epilepsy, etc.). Their experiences ranged from personal diagnosis to supporting diagnosed family members and friends. The group also shared a passion for the outdoors, an unyielding enthusiasm for life, and a drive to overcoming the hardship of a diagnosis to enhance quality of life. These commonalities inspired the idea of Outdoor Mindset (OM). Now, the ongoing connections made by OM broaden the story.

Social connections positively influence health.

We all know someone who has faced a neurological challenge. 

Getting outdoors and being active helps.

By working with communities across the United States to link new and existing services, and by supporting the development of recreational, occupational and housing programs, Challenge America is better able to serve those individuals in their home communities.

Returning warriors and military families are inundated with information from both the public and private sectors. Bridging between the two sectors and providing a user-friendly tool to access and retrieve relevant and pertinent information – information that is truly important to the user – is the key to serving the needs of the warrior population effectively. This will be accomplished by:

•Making information about quality-of-life programs readily accessible via a standardized database searchable by zip code on an easily navigable website

The Dear Jack Foundation supports initiatives and provides programming in order to promote positive health outcomes for adolescents and young adults (AYA), ages 15-39, from the moment they are diagnosed with cancer through survivorship.



Through our programs and strategic partnerships, we address the physical and emotional needs of AYA cancer patients and survivors. Our one-on-one patient outreach and peer-to-peer group wellness programs allow us to empower patients and survivors in their healing and provide assurance that they are not alone in their cancer journey.
Our Story

In the spring of 2005, Andrew McMahon and his band Jack’s Mannequin embarked on their first U.S. headlining tour. However, before completing the tour, Andrew paid a visit to his voice doctor in New York City due to a growing number of health concerns. The results from the blood work that came back the following morning were alarming and Andrew was quickly admitted to New York Presbyterian Hospital. Ultimately, everyone’s worst fears were confirmed: Andrew had Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL).

Throughout the summer of 2005, Andrew underwent two rounds of chemotherapy, radiation treatment, and, with a stroke of good luck, a successful stem cell transplant from his sister.  During his battle with ALL, it became clear to Andrew that in a generation where cancer has become the second largest cause of death in the US and the biggest public action item relevant to health, there were still major shortfalls in treatment, support, and research on behalf of the young adult demographic.

In an effort to initiate change and provide a voice for the generations of young adults who have been diagnosed with cancer, Andrew founded the Dear Jack Foundation in July of 2006.

CHP is supported entirely by donations from private individuals, foundations, and over 40 Episcopal churches in Colorado. Our primary mission is with the Episcopal Mission of St. Paul's, where we work in collaboration with the Priest-in-Charge, Father Abiade Lozama and community members, to help provide education, vocational training, health care, nutrition and clean water within the mission setting.

Haiti: In Petit Trou, the Colorado Haiti Project works to build relationships that cultivate community development that empowers individuals and is locally driven. Our work supports the vision of our Haitian sisters and brothers in building lives of dignity and economic self-sufficiency. Our education and vocational opportunities are vital to the long-term success of this community. While our work in clean water and community health promotes decentralization by building  permanently integrated infrastructure in and around the community of Petit Trou de Nippes, Haiti.

Colorado:  Throughout Colorado, we actively raise awareness and mobilize resources to support and sustain programs in Haiti.  We are committed to providing local opportunities for interactive growth that fosters relationship development and recognizes the rights and capabilities of our Haitian sisters and brothers.

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children. Thanks to the dedication of thousands of volunteers nationwide, two to three cargo containers of life-saving aid leave Project C.U.R.E.’s warehouses every week.

ACT was developed as a response to a glaring community need for an outlet for multiple issues for families of people with disabilities.  ACT is genuinely 100% inclusive & 1 of a kind!
We work with any disability & any age range & include the entire family.  We also provide the equipment for our participants since the cost can be extremely prohibitive

GOALS

There are multiple goals for ACT, which were realized as a direct need of its clientele
* Physical exercise for people with disabilities & their families as well
* Shift the life experiences of the person with the disability, their family & society as a whole
* Give the person with the disability, as well as their family, a new perspective on their abilities and for the family as an entire family unit
* Sense of freedom & self-confidence that comes with riding a bike

CURRENT PROGRAMS

We currently offer 4 programs
Local programs include clinics & day trips.  Clinics are offered for someone of a beginner, or haven’t ridden in a long time, rider.  Our day trips are designed for the beginner/intermediate rider

Non-local programs are overnight trips & longer week-long excursions.  Our overnight & longer trips include both biking & some other sport(s).

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children. Thanks to the dedication of thousands of volunteers nationwide, two to three cargo containers of life-saving aid leave Project C.U.R.E.’s warehouses every week.

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children. Thanks to the dedication of thousands of volunteers nationwide, two to three cargo containers of life-saving aid leave Project C.U.R.E.’s warehouses every week.

We started as a nonprofit in 2005 when there were 18,031 dropouts across the state of Colorado, and 2015-2016 school year shows that just over 10,000 youth dropped out of school. Because even one dropout is too many, we are committed to continuing this work through thoughtful partnerships, early intervention, late intervention, and an expansion of school options. The unemployment rate for those individuals without a high school diploma is nearly double that of the general public, and those that have dropped out of school are more likely to live in poverty, commit crimes, and become teenage parents.

This year, Colorado Youth for a Change worked in the following Colorado public school districts:  Denver Public Schools, Aurora Public Schools, Englewood Schools, Boulder Valley School District, Brighton 27J, Adams 14, Mapleton Public Schools, Lake County School District, and JeffCo.",Nonprofit Organization Management,https://www.linkedin.com/company/4814332,$1M-$5M,11.0,11-50 employees,http://www.moat.com/advertiser/Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change,http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/youthforachange.org,https://www.google.com/#q=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change&tbm=nws,"http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change-reviews-SRCH_KE0,27.htm",http://www.google.com/finance?q=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change,https://www.google.com/search?q=Winters%20Heafey%20Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change,http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change&locT=&locId=&jobType=all,https://www.google.com/search?q=Denver%2C%20Colorado+sports+teams,https://www.google.com/search?q=Denver%2C%20Colorado+weather,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change&as_qdr=all&num=100&meta=&filter=0,http://www.semrush.com/info/youthforachange.org,http://www.keywordspy.com/research/search.aspx?q=youthforachange.org&tab=domain-overview,http://www.ispionage.com/research/US/youthforachange.org,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change&owner=exclude&action=getcompany,https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/subdomains?target=youthforachange.org,https://www.similarsitesearch.com/search/?URL=youthforachange.org,http://socialmention.com/search?q=youthforachange.org&t=all&btnG=Search,http://www.social-searcher.com/social-buzz/?q5=youthforachange.org,http://www.icerocket.com/search?q=Winters%20Heafey,https://twitter.com/search?q=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change&vertical=default&f=tweets,http://www.builtwith.com/youthforachange.org,http://www.similarweb.com/website/youthforachange.org,https://www.woorank.com/en/www/youthforachange.org,https://website.grader.com/tests/youthforachange.org,http://www.whois.com/whois/youthforachange.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change,http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change,,,,,,,Colorado_Non_Profits

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children. Thanks to the dedication of thousands of volunteers nationwide, two to three cargo containers of life-saving aid leave Project C.U.R.E.’s warehouses every week.

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children. Thanks to the dedication of thousands of volunteers nationwide, two to three cargo containers of life-saving aid leave Project C.U.R.E.’s warehouses every week.

Setan and Randa came to America as refugees having 
miraculously escaped the horrors of the Killing Fields in Cambodia.  After working as a social worker in Colorado for many years, Setan felt called by God to take the Gospel message back to his home country.  There he saw a need to rescue women and children trapped by the sex trade and share Christ with them.  He and his wife founded Kampuchea for Christ and opened the New Development Center as a place where women taken from the sex trade could be protected and given new trade skills.  Since then Kampuchea for Christ has opened other centers and orphanages to protect children and prevent women and children from being drawn into the sex trade.  Through all of this God has provided evangelistic opportunities to share His amazing message of grace and freedom through Christ

Our mission is to educate senior decision-makers in business, government and civil society about the principles of sustainability. Natural Capitalism Solutions shows how to restore and further enhance natural and human capital while increasing prosperity and quality of life. In partnership with leading thinkers and groups, Natural Capitalism Solutions creates innovative, practical tools and implementation strategies for companies, communities and countries. Natural Capitalism Solutions (NCS) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

The principles used by Natural Capitalism Solutions are:

1. Buy time by using resources dramatically more productively.
This slows resource depletion, lessens pollution, and increases employment in meaningful jobs. It lowers costs for business and society, halts the degradation of the biosphere, makes it more profitable to employ people, and preserves vital living systems and social cohesion.

2. Redesign industrial processes and the delivery of products and services to do business as nature does, using such approaches as biomimicry and cradle to cradle.
This approach enables a wide array of materials to be produced with low energy flows, in processes that run on sunlight, emulating natures genius.  It shifts to circular economies in which materials are reused, remanufactured and waste is eliminated.

3. Manage all institutions to be restorative of natural and human capital.
Such approaches enhance human well-being and enable the biosphere to produce more wealth from its intact communities and abundant ecosystem services and natural resources.",Nonprofit Organization Management,https://www.linkedin.com/company/849908,$100K-$1M,10.0,2-10 employees,http://www.moat.com/advertiser/Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions,http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/natcapsolutions.org,https://www.google.com/#q=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions&tbm=nws,"http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions-reviews-SRCH_KE0,28.htm",http://www.google.com/finance?q=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions,https://www.google.com/search?q=Hunter%20Lovins%20Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions,http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions&locT=&locId=&jobType=all,https://www.google.com/search?q=Longmont%2C%20Colorado+sports+teams,https://www.google.com/search?q=Longmont%2C%20Colorado+weather,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions&as_qdr=all&num=100&meta=&filter=0,http://www.semrush.com/info/natcapsolutions.org,http://www.keywordspy.com/research/search.aspx?q=natcapsolutions.org&tab=domain-overview,http://www.ispionage.com/research/US/natcapsolutions.org,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions&owner=exclude&action=getcompany,https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/subdomains?target=natcapsolutions.org,https://www.similarsitesearch.com/search/?URL=natcapsolutions.org,http://socialmention.com/search?q=natcapsolutions.org&t=all&btnG=Search,http://www.social-searcher.com/social-buzz/?q5=natcapsolutions.org,http://www.icerocket.com/search?q=Hunter%20Lovins,https://twitter.com/search?q=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions&vertical=default&f=tweets,http://www.builtwith.com/natcapsolutions.org,http://www.similarweb.com/website/natcapsolutions.org,https://www.woorank.com/en/www/natcapsolutions.org,https://website.grader.com/tests/natcapsolutions.org,http://www.whois.com/whois/natcapsolutions.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions,http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=Natural%20Capitalism%20Solutions,,,,,,,Colorado_Non_Profits

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children.

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children. Thanks to the dedication of thousands of volunteers nationwide, two to three cargo containers of life-saving aid leave Project C.U.R.E.’s warehouses every week.

Our mission consists of three main focus areas:  Awareness, Fund-Raising, and Cooperation

AWARENESS:  VP2H’s Primary mission is to raise awareness within the Colorado area about the issues Veterans face:  Multiple tours in combat zones, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), high unemployment rate, high homelessness rate, high divorce rate, and a record high suicide rate. As the military mission winds down in Iraq and Afghanistan and veterans reintegrate themselves into civilian society, we believe that this awareness will foster an understanding of their efforts and compassion for their struggle.

FUND-RAISING:  VP2H’s secondary mission is to raise money for veteran friendly non-profits. Through due diligence and research, we organize fund raising events which support local, veteran friendly non-profits. We only support high quality charities that maximize their accountability to veteran’s causes and are transparent in their fund raising and giving practices.

COOPERATION:  VP2H’s tertiary mission is to act as a rallying point for other veteran friendly non-profits. Our goal is to organize and conduct meetings with the leadership teams of these groups within the Colorado area with the goal of finding ways for us to work together more efficiently. We believe that by working together and by sharing ideas, we can reduce competition between non-profit groups and more efficiently and more effectively help veterans.",Nonprofit Organization Management,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2754787,$100K-$1M,2.0,2-10 employees,http://www.moat.com/advertiser/Veteran's%20Passport%20to%20Hope,http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/veteranspassport2hope.org,https://www.google.com/#q=Veteran's%20Passport%20to%20Hope&tbm=nws,"http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Veteran's%20Passport%20to%20Hope-reviews-SRCH_KE0,26.htm",http://www.google.com/finance?q=Veteran's%20Passport%20to%20Hope,https://www.google.com/search?q=Kyle%20Grivette%20Veteran's%20Passport%20to%20Hope,http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Veteran's%20Passport%20to%20Hope&locT=&locId=&jobType=all,https://www.google.com/search?q=Denver%2C%20Colorado+sports+teams,https://www.google.com/search?q=Denver%2C%20Colorado+weather,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Veteran's%20Passport%20to%20Hope&as_qdr=all&num=100&meta=&filter=0,http://www.semrush.com/info/veteranspassport2hope.org,http://www.keywordspy.com/research/search.aspx?q=veteranspassport2hope.org&tab=domain-overview,http://www.ispionage.com/research/US/veteranspassport2hope.org,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Veteran's%20Passport%20to%20Hope&owner=exclude&action=getcompany,https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/subdomains?target=veteranspassport2hope.org,https://www.similarsitesearch.com/search/?URL=veteranspassport2hope.org,http://socialmention.com/search?q=veteranspassport2hope.org&t=all&btnG=Search,http://www.social-searcher.com/social-buzz/?q5=veteranspassport2hope.org,http://www.icerocket.com/search?q=Kyle%20Grivette,https://twitter.com/search?q=Veteran's%20Passport%20to%20Hope&vertical=default&f=tweets,http://www.builtwith.com/veteranspassport2hope.org,http://www.similarweb.com/website/veteranspassport2hope.org,https://www.woorank.com/en/www/veteranspassport2hope.org,https://website.grader.com/tests/veteranspassport2hope.org,http://www.whois.com/whois/veteranspassport2hope.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran's%20Passport%20to%20Hope,http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=Veteran's%20Passport%20to%20Hope,,,,,,,Colorado_Non_Profits

Housed in a beautiful, architecturally modern building in Stapleton, Anchor Center is designed to address the unique learning styles of young children with vision impairments.  Walk in the door and find specialized lighting, acoustics and a myriad of textures that help children find their way around.  A stroll through the sensory gardens will delight all visitors as they experience bright colors, interesting textures and pleasing scents.  

Children from birth through five and their families are served at this magical place.  Parents begin their journey by attending programs where they and their babies learn to simply enjoy each other and get used to seeing the world using senses other than vision.  By the time children turn into toddlers they, like all children, begin to think the world revolves around them. Parents begin to step back and let their children take the lead.  Observers of the preschool will see rambunctious children navigating their way using canes and utilizing early Braille skills to read.

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth.

Since our founding in 2001, VOW has been on a quest to enlighten, educate, and embrace different cultures and beliefs. In direct response to the horrors of September 11, a small group of concerned women gathered on October 17, 2001 to discuss the contribution women could make in decisions that involve our global community.

Women have a unique voice to add to the global conversation on peace, and this voice is largely unheard within policy-making circles. We believe that it is time for women to take their place at all decision-making tables. We know that one of us is not as strong as the sum of us in our global community, and we need collective strength in order to combat negativity and oppression. We believe that understanding religions and race will lead to peace. We aspire to establish communication and connection among people of diverse cultures.

To date, we have staged 70+ educational programs, partnered with like-minded organizations to increase our reach, and honored other non-profit organizations that are walking a similar path. VOW does not only focus on raising awareness, but has also raised considerable funds for projects that contribute to global equity. Our donation to the United Nations Association of San Diego became school supplies in Afghanistan. The funds we sent to Save the Children benefited women and children in Iraq. Other monies have helped women in Nepal and India start home-based businesses and contributed to the construction of a school in Jalalabad.",Nonprofit Organization Management,https://www.linkedin.com/company/3721433,$100K-$1M,2.0,2-10 employees,http://www.moat.com/advertiser/Voices%20of%20Women,http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/thevoicesofwomen.org,https://www.google.com/#q=Voices%20of%20Women&tbm=nws,"http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Voices%20of%20Women-reviews-SRCH_KE0,15.htm",http://www.google.com/finance?q=Voices%20of%20Women,https://www.google.com/search?q=June%20Davidson%20Voices%20of%20Women,http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Voices%20of%20Women&locT=&locId=&jobType=all,https://www.google.com/search?q=Pasadena%2C%20Colorado+sports+teams,https://www.google.com/search?q=Pasadena%2C%20Colorado+weather,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Voices%20of%20Women&as_qdr=all&num=100&meta=&filter=0,http://www.semrush.com/info/thevoicesofwomen.org,http://www.keywordspy.com/research/search.aspx?q=thevoicesofwomen.org&tab=domain-overview,http://www.ispionage.com/research/US/thevoicesofwomen.org,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Voices%20of%20Women&owner=exclude&action=getcompany,https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/subdomains?target=thevoicesofwomen.org,https://www.similarsitesearch.com/search/?URL=thevoicesofwomen.org,http://socialmention.com/search?q=thevoicesofwomen.org&t=all&btnG=Search,http://www.social-searcher.com/social-buzz/?q5=thevoicesofwomen.org,http://www.icerocket.com/search?q=June%20Davidson,https://twitter.com/search?q=Voices%20of%20Women&vertical=default&f=tweets,http://www.builtwith.com/thevoicesofwomen.org,http://www.similarweb.com/website/thevoicesofwomen.org,https://www.woorank.com/en/www/thevoicesofwomen.org,https://website.grader.com/tests/thevoicesofwomen.org,http://www.whois.com/whois/thevoicesofwomen.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voices%20of%20Women,http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=Voices%20of%20Women,,,,,,,Colorado_Non_Profits

IT ALL STARTED WHEN…
Malas for Tatas was Co-Founded by sisters Erin LeBel and Shannon Briese. In early 2018, Erin was diagnosed with breast cancer. Shannon felt compelled to support her, and being a wellness professional, she knew the impact holistic treatments could have in easing Erin’s discomfort and the symptoms of chemotherapy. However, she also knew that these treatments were not covered by Erin’s health insurance, and that Erin would be unlikely to splurge on them for herself. 

Shannon started making prayer malas and selling them to raise money for Erin’s treatment. Her community responded immediately, and after a few months Shannon was able to fund reiki therapy, acupuncture, and nutrition consultation for her sister. 

Feeling it was time to pay it forward to someone else, the sisters asked their network to nominate a second recipient: another woman with breast cancer who wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford alternative health care treatments.

Malas for Tatas aims to support two women a year, providing them funds for 6 months of self-care or $2,000, whichever comes first. One-hundred percent of the profits from each mala sold go directly toward our current recipient, contributing to her well-being and recovery. We are a Colorado based 501(C)(3) nonprofit organization serving the Denver Metro community.

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children. Thanks to the dedication of thousands of volunteers nationwide, two to three cargo containers of life-saving aid leave Project C.U.R.E.’s warehouses every week.

We started as a nonprofit in 2005 when there were 18,031 dropouts across the state of Colorado, and 2015-2016 school year shows that just over 10,000 youth dropped out of school. Because even one dropout is too many, we are committed to continuing this work through thoughtful partnerships, early intervention, late intervention, and an expansion of school options. The unemployment rate for those individuals without a high school diploma is nearly double that of the general public, and those that have dropped out of school are more likely to live in poverty, commit crimes, and become teenage parents.

This year, Colorado Youth for a Change worked in the following Colorado public school districts:  Denver Public Schools, Aurora Public Schools, Englewood Schools, Boulder Valley School District, Brighton 27J, Adams 14, Mapleton Public Schools, Lake County School District, and JeffCo.",Nonprofit Organization Management,https://www.linkedin.com/company/4814332,$1M-$5M,11.0,11-50 employees,http://www.moat.com/advertiser/Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change,http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/youthforachange.org,https://www.google.com/#q=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change&tbm=nws,"http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change-reviews-SRCH_KE0,27.htm",http://www.google.com/finance?q=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change,https://www.google.com/search?q=Mary%20Zanotti%20Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change,http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change&locT=&locId=&jobType=all,https://www.google.com/search?q=Denver%2C%20Colorado+sports+teams,https://www.google.com/search?q=Denver%2C%20Colorado+weather,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change&as_qdr=all&num=100&meta=&filter=0,http://www.semrush.com/info/youthforachange.org,http://www.keywordspy.com/research/search.aspx?q=youthforachange.org&tab=domain-overview,http://www.ispionage.com/research/US/youthforachange.org,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change&owner=exclude&action=getcompany,https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/subdomains?target=youthforachange.org,https://www.similarsitesearch.com/search/?URL=youthforachange.org,http://socialmention.com/search?q=youthforachange.org&t=all&btnG=Search,http://www.social-searcher.com/social-buzz/?q5=youthforachange.org,http://www.icerocket.com/search?q=Mary%20Zanotti,https://twitter.com/search?q=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change&vertical=default&f=tweets,http://www.builtwith.com/youthforachange.org,http://www.similarweb.com/website/youthforachange.org,https://www.woorank.com/en/www/youthforachange.org,https://website.grader.com/tests/youthforachange.org,http://www.whois.com/whois/youthforachange.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change,http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=Colorado%20Youth%20for%20a%20Change,,,,,,,Colorado_Non_Profits

Wish for Wheels is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that gives brand new bicycles and helmets to kids in low income communities. Founded in 2004, our first giveaway made it clear that the bikes bring health and happiness into these kids’ lives and for that reason, we are committed to making a difference.

Our unique model bundles corporate philanthropy, team building, and employee engagements through bike builds, to deliver brand new bikes to kids in the community. We are successful thanks to the generosity of our corporate partners and volunteers in the community. 

OUR MISSION
Our mission, through the gift of a new bicycle, is to transform the lives of kids from low-income families, broadening their scope for personal growth and a healthy lifestyle.

OUR VISION
Our vision is that every kid will one day have a new bicycle and helmet.

OUR VALUES
We believe that bicycles improve the quality of life for kids and their communities through:

 * Education
 * Safety

Housed in a beautiful, architecturally modern building in Stapleton, Anchor Center is designed to address the unique learning styles of young children with vision impairments.  Walk in the door and find specialized lighting, acoustics and a myriad of textures that help children find their way around.  A stroll through the sensory gardens will delight all visitors as they experience bright colors, interesting textures and pleasing scents.  

Children from birth through five and their families are served at this magical place.  Parents begin their journey by attending programs where they and their babies learn to simply enjoy each other and get used to seeing the world using senses other than vision.  By the time children turn into toddlers they, like all children, begin to think the world revolves around them. Parents begin to step back and let their children take the lead.  Observers of the preschool will see rambunctious children navigating their way using canes and utilizing early Braille skills to read.

Housed in a beautiful, architecturally modern building in Stapleton, Anchor Center is designed to address the unique learning styles of young children with vision impairments.  Walk in the door and find specialized lighting, acoustics and a myriad of textures that help children find their way around.  A stroll through the sensory gardens will delight all visitors as they experience bright colors, interesting textures and pleasing scents.  

Children from birth through five and their families are served at this magical place.  Parents begin their journey by attending programs where they and their babies learn to simply enjoy each other and get used to seeing the world using senses other than vision.  By the time children turn into toddlers they, like all children, begin to think the world revolves around them. Parents begin to step back and let their children take the lead.  Observers of the preschool will see rambunctious children navigating their way using canes and utilizing early Braille skills to read.

Wish for Wheels is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that gives brand new bicycles and helmets to kids in low income communities.

Our unique model bundles corporate philanthropy, team building, and employee engagements through bike builds, to deliver brand new bikes to kids in the community. We are successful thanks to the generosity of our corporate partners and volunteers in the community. 

OUR MISSION
Our mission, through the gift of a new bicycle, is to transform the lives of kids from low-income families, broadening their scope for personal growth and a healthy lifestyle.

OUR VISION
Our vision is that every kid will one day have a new bicycle and helmet.

OUR VALUES
We believe that bicycles improve the quality of life for kids and their communities through:
 * Health
 * Education

By working with communities across the United States to link new and existing services, and by supporting the development of recreational, occupational and housing programs, Challenge America is better able to serve those individuals in their home communities.

Returning warriors and military families are inundated with information from both the public and private sectors. Bridging between the two sectors and providing a user-friendly tool to access and retrieve relevant and pertinent information – information that is truly important to the user – is the key to serving the needs of the warrior population effectively. This will be accomplished by:

•Making information about quality-of-life programs readily accessible via a standardized database searchable by zip code on an easily navigable website

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children. Thanks to the dedication of thousands of volunteers nationwide, two to three cargo containers of life-saving aid leave Project C.U.R.E.’s warehouses every week.

Imagine a world in which the real definition of the word “competition” is collaboration.  This is a  world where visionary nonprofits are joined at the table by socially responsible corporate, public sector, and academic leaders. These relationships are at the heart of every successful collaboration. 

Rebecca is the Founder and President of A Foot in the Door Productions - an independent, collaboration-building firm designed to bridge the varying needs of business, government, nonprofits, and academia. A “serial social entrepreneur”, her three businesses (A Foot in Door Productions, Mission First Solutions, and repFIVE) are disruptive innovations providing social value and systemic change in how people do work, develop efficiencies and create sustainability. 

With 20 years experience in public relations, fundraising, and collaboration-building Rebecca first rallied her talents in Colorado on behalf of the Huntington’s Disease Society of America, developing many grass-roots campaigns (including annual Hoop-a-thons) to fund Centers of Excellence nationwide.  

These campaigns continue to raise awareness and funds today.

OUR MISSION
Our mission, through the gift of a new bicycle, is to transform the lives of kids from low-income families, broadening their scope for personal growth and a healthy lifestyle.

OUR VISION

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children. Thanks to the dedication of thousands of volunteers nationwide, two to three cargo containers of life-saving aid leave Project C.U.R.E.’s warehouses every week.

Returning warriors and military families are inundated with information from both the public and private sectors. Bridging between the two sectors and providing a user-friendly tool to access and retrieve relevant and pertinent information – information that is truly important to the user – is the key to serving the needs of the warrior population effectively. This will be accomplished by:

•Making information about quality-of-life programs readily accessible via a standardized database searchable by zip code on an easily navigable website 
•Expanding the geographic reach of existing quality-of-life initiatives.
•Facilitating conferences, seminars, and publications with a focus on best practices and making relevant and cutting-edge information available to those who need it.

Working with our compassionate community, we will end pet homelessness and animal suffering.

About Us

For over 100 years, the Dumb Friends League has been working to end pet homelessness and animal suffering by providing a strong and steadfast voice for those who cannot speak for themselves. As the largest community-based animal welfare organization in the region, we care for more than 21,000 homeless pets and horses each year.

The Dumb Friends League is the only animal champion with unmatched expertise who provides compassionate care through the most comprehensive, direct services for any pet in Colorado who is vulnerable to homelessness, suffering and abuse because every pet in our community deserves to be nurtured, safe and cherished. We will work together in a united coalition to promote socially conscious sheltering to create the best outcomes for all animals, promote safe communities and nurture the human-animal bond.

The Dumb Friends League has five facilities, including:
• Two shelters for homeless pets that offer adoptions, pet admissions, lost-and-found services and humane education classes for the public:
     The Leslie A. Malone Center in Denver
     The Buddy Center in Castle Rock
• The Harmony Equine Center, a private rehabilitation and adoption center for equine victims of mistreatment, as well as horses that come from partner humane societies and rescue groups to receive professional training and opportunities for new lives.
• Solutions–Veterinary Hospital, a full-service animal hospital for owned pets to prevent and alleviate suffering in pets whose caretakers would otherwise be unable to provide this medical care.
• Solutions–Cat Spay/Neuter Clinic,® which offers free spay/neuter surgeries and FVRCP and (age appropriate) rabies vaccinations for Colorado cats, including owned cats and community cats.

We are church-based: Compassion believes the Church is God’s chosen instrument to bring hope to a hurting world.
We believe the strategic placement of local churches makes them best suited to address the holistic needs of the children in their communities. And only they can effectively deliver the Jesus-based teaching and whole-life care that children in poverty deserve. Compassion partners with nearly 7,000 churches in 25 countries around the world to deliver our holistic child development program.

We are child-focused: Compassion’s ministry is focused on the individual child and his/her development. We offer this assistance irrespective of caste, creed, class or religion. At Compassion, we believe entire communities will feel the positive impact of our presence because what happens in the life of a child ripples throughout his or her environment. 

We are Christ-centered: Jesus is the core of our ministry and his life and teachings shape our programs. They reflect the spiritual commitments of our staff. And they guide how we love people, respect communities and cooperate with nations.

We are committed to integrity: We hold ourselves to the highest professional and biblical principles in all aspects of our ministry and maintain the highest industry standards for our allocation of funds.

Each year over 460,000 children in the United States are thrust into court through no fault of their own.  Some are victims of violence, psychological torment or sexual abuse. Others have been neglected or even abandoned by their own parents. Most of them are frightened and confused.

Often, these children also become victims of this country’s overburdened child welfare system – a complex legal network of lawyers, caseworkers and judges who frequently are too overburdened to give thorough, detailed attention to each child who comes before them. The consequences can be severe.
 
All children deserve a safe, permanent home!
 
Every year Colorado spends over $350 million on prisons, but less than $7 million on the prevention of abuse and neglect of children. A large percentage of the adults currently incarcerated were abused as children. Clearly, helping abused children today is the way to address many of society’s problems tomorrow.

Educate! provides youth with skills training in leadership, entrepreneurship and workforce readiness along with mentorship to start real businesses at school. Our model is delivered through practically-trained teachers and youth mentors. Educate!’s goal is to make this practical, skills-based model part of national education systems.

In 2016, we worked in 100 schools in Rwanda and 397 secondary schools in Uganda, reaching over 240,000 students. Our model was proven to have massive impact in a randomized controlled trial. Graduates earned DOUBLE the income of a control group and had a 64% increase in business creation. Our graduates change their lives and their communities, such as Lillian Aero who employs over 100 AIDS-affected women.

In 2012, Educate! partnered with Uganda’s government to integrate curriculum and a student business club structure into Uganda's entrepreneurship course nationally, and in 2015 we began serving as a technical advisor to Rwanda on their national curriculum reform.

Educate!’s team includes 100 staff and over 140 volunteer youth mentors. We have been backed by top foundations such as MasterCard, Big Bang Philanthropy, Mulago, Echoing Green, Ashoka and Global Innovation Fund. Educate! won the 2015 WISE Awards, and was featured by Forbes 30 under 30, Clinton Global Initiative and The Brookings Institution.

(Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) was founded in 1987 by James Jackson, who was working as an international economic consultant in developing countries when his work put him face to face with the needs of the sick and dying. During a trip to Brazil, Dr. Jackson visited a small clinic near Rio de Janeiro, where he learned that patients were often turned away due to a lack of basic medical supplies. Jackson was moved to action, making a promise to the clinic doctor that he would help provide relief to the people there.

From its humble beginnings in Colorado, Project C.U.R.E. has expanded to many other cities across the United States. Currently, Project C.U.R.E. maintains large distribution warehouses in Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee. In addition, Project C.U.R.E. has established smaller collection centers several other states where donated items are gathered and then delivered to its warehouses. Since its founding, Project C.U.R.E. has reached patients, families and children in 130 countries.

Today, Project C.U.R.E.'s work and mission are more important than ever, helping to bridge staggering health resource gaps in the developing world by empowering doctors and nurses with the tools they need to treat disease, deliver vaccines, perform life-changing surgeries and ensure safe childbirth. Through the compassion of Project C.U.R.E.'s supporters, hospitals, rural clinics and community health centers all over the world are able to offer quality care and critical medical services to their most vulnerable patients, especially women and young children. Thanks to the dedication of thousands of volunteers nationwide, two to three cargo containers of life-saving aid leave Project C.U.R.E.’s warehouses every week.

Special Olympics also believes that through sports training and competition, people with intellectual disabilities benefit physically, mentally, socially and spiritually; families are strengthened; and the community at large, both through participation and observation, is united in understanding people with intellectual disabilities in an environment of equality, respect and acceptance.",Nonprofit Organization Management,https://www.linkedin.com/company/95928,$5M-$20M,60.0,51-200 employees,http://www.moat.com/advertiser/Special%20Olympics%20Colorado,http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/specialolympicsco.org,https://www.google.com/#q=Special%20Olympics%20Colorado&tbm=nws,"http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Special%20Olympics%20Colorado-reviews-SRCH_KE0,25.htm",http://www.google.com/finance?q=Special%20Olympics%20Colorado,https://www.google.com/search?q=Claire%20Simmons%20Special%20Olympics%20Colorado,http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Special%20Olympics%20Colorado&locT=&locId=&jobType=all,https://www.google.com/search?q=Englewood%2C%20Colorado+sports+teams,https://www.google.com/search?q=Englewood%2C%20Colorado+weather,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Special%20Olympics%20Colorado&as_qdr=all&num=100&meta=&filter=0,http://www.semrush.com/info/specialolympicsco.org,http://www.keywordspy.com/research/search.aspx?q=specialolympicsco.org&tab=domain-overview,http://www.ispionage.com/research/US/specialolympicsco.org,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Special%20Olympics%20Colorado&owner=exclude&action=getcompany,https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/subdomains?target=specialolympicsco.org,https://www.similarsitesearch.com/search/?URL=specialolympicsco.org,http://socialmention.com/search?q=specialolympicsco.org&t=all&btnG=Search,http://www.social-searcher.com/social-buzz/?q5=specialolympicsco.org,http://www.icerocket.com/search?q=Claire%20Simmons,https://twitter.com/search?q=Special%20Olympics%20Colorado&vertical=default&f=tweets,http://www.builtwith.com/specialolympicsco.org,http://www.similarweb.com/website/specialolympicsco.org,https://www.woorank.com/en/www/specialolympicsco.org,https://website.grader.com/tests/specialolympicsco.org,http://www.whois.com/whois/specialolympicsco.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special%20Olympics%20Colorado,http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=Special%20Olympics%20Colorado,,,,,,,Colorado_Non_Profits
