It recognizes individuals who have met ABS standards specifically in the area of general surgery and its related specialties. This is different from possessing a medical license, which is the minimum required by law to practice medicine and is not specialty specific.

Members of the American College of Surgeons are referred to as ""Fellows.""​ The letters FACS (Fellow, American College of Surgeons) after a surgeon's name mean that the surgeon's education and training, professional qualifications, surgical competence, and ethical conduct have passed a rigorous evaluation, and have been found to be consistent with the high standards established and demanded by the College.

There is also another category of membership known as ""Associate Fellow.""​ This category was established to provide an opportunity for surgeons who are beginning surgical practice and who meet specific requirements to assume an active role in the College at an early stage in their careers.

In addition, there are categories of membership for surgical residents, medical students, and members of the surgical team.

The College currently has approximately 78,000 members, including more than 4,000 Fellows in other countries, making it the largest organization of surgeons in the world.

The History

The idea to provide skin care products unparalleled in quality and effectiveness developed in Switzerland in 1975, when one man, Petter Mørck, together with a group of leading bio-chemists, biologists and herbalists, fulfilled his vision and founded Arbonne.

Arbonne's skin care products, based on botanical principles, became a reality in the United States in 1980 and are now shared throughout the world through Arbonne's network of Independent Consultants. Building on these same founding principles, Arbonne's product line has since grown to include both inner and outer health and beauty products that are unparalleled in quality, safety, value, benefits and results!

The wonderful thing about Arbonne is that it's not just about great products, it's also about great people. The Arbonne family is made up of thousands of individuals working to make their dreams come true. Through sales incentives and rewards, travel opportunities, a generous SuccessPlan and great products, Arbonne offers a unique opportunity that can help make anyone's vision for the future a reality.",Consumer Goods,https://www.linkedin.com/company/162497,$50M-$100M,18290,"10,001+ employees",http://www.moat.com/advertiser/Arbonne%20International%20LLC,http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/arbonne.com,https://www.google.com/#q=Arbonne%20International%20LLC&tbm=nws,"http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Arbonne%20International%20LLC-reviews-SRCH_KE0,25.htm",http://www.google.com/finance?q=Arbonne%20International%20LLC,https://www.google.com/search?q=Andrea%20Chase%20Arbonne%20International%20LLC,http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=0&suggestChosen=false&sc.keyword=Arbonne%20International%20LLC&locT=&locId=&jobType=all,https://www.google.com/search?q=Irvine%2C%20California+sports+teams,https://www.google.com/search?q=Irvine%2C%20California+weather,https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Arbonne%20International%20LLC&as_qdr=all&num=100&meta=&filter=0,http://www.semrush.com/info/arbonne.com,http://www.keywordspy.com/research/search.aspx?q=arbonne.com&tab=domain-overview,http://www.ispionage.com/research/US/arbonne.com,https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Arbonne%20International%20LLC&owner=exclude&action=getcompany,https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/subdomains?target=arbonne.com,https://www.similarsitesearch.com/search/?URL=arbonne.com,http://socialmention.com/search?q=arbonne.com&t=all&btnG=Search,http://www.social-searcher.com/social-buzz/?q5=arbonne.com,http://www.icerocket.com/search?q=Andrea%20Chase,https://twitter.com/search?q=Arbonne%20International%20LLC&vertical=default&f=tweets,http://www.builtwith.com/arbonne.com,http://www.similarweb.com/website/arbonne.com,https://www.woorank.com/en/www/arbonne.com,https://website.grader.com/tests/arbonne.com,http://www.whois.com/whois/arbonne.com,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbonne%20International%20LLC,http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=Arbonne%20International%20LLC

We remain steadfast to our original mission—to bring new treatments to market that will make a big impact on small patient populations. These patient populations are mostly children, suffering from diseases so rare, that the entire patient population can number as few as 1,000 people worldwide. These conditions are often inherited, difficult to diagnose, progressively debilitating, have few, if any, treatment options and are usually ignored.  

Time is critical to patients with rare diseases, and we strive to quickly develop important therapies for them. The efficiency and speed of our research, development, manufacturing, and commercial efforts is at the heart of our ability to urgently deliver therapies. Our track record of developing and commercializing new treatments has been significantly faster than the industry average and is a remarkable accomplishment that is ingrained in our culture. The company's product portfolio comprises five marketed products and multiple clinical and pre-clinical product candidates.

We’re Everlane. 

We launched in 2011 with a question: Why would you pay $70 for a t-shirt—that only cost $7 to make?

We want the right choice to be as easy as putting on a great T-shirt. That’s why we partner with ethical factories all around the world. Source only the finest materials—from our premium Grade-A cashmere to our vegetable-tanned Italian leather. And share the stories behind every product we make with our customer—down to the cost of shipping and materials. 

It’s a new way of doing things. We call it Radical Transparency.

It’s called global trade. And freight forwarding is the $2 trillion industry that functions as the circulatory system of global trade — without freight forwarding, global trade simply wouldn’t exist.
 
Problem is, the freight forwarding industry is antiquated, not customer focused, and definitely not tech savvy. We’re changing all that.
 
FLEXPORT IS THE MODERN FREIGHT FORWARDER.
 
Only Flexport brings together advanced technology and data analytics, logistics infrastructure, and supply chain expertise to deliver a dramatically better experience. Flexport and the Operating System for Global Trade give businesses what they’ve never had before with their freight forwarders: Deep visibility and control from origin to destination, fast and reliable transit times, and low and predictable supply chain costs.
 
First to market in 2013 with a purpose-built cloud software and data analytics platform, Flexport today serves more than 10,000 clients in over 100 countries, offering a full range of services, including ocean, air, truck and rail freight, drayage & cartage, warehousing, customs & compliance, financing and insurance — all informed and powered by our software platform.
 
Flexport has offices in San Francisco (HQ), New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Copenhagen, Vancouver, and Dallas (and expanding rapidly). We have warehouses in Los Angeles, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Chicago. We’re taking the market by storm:

How about Kansas City? That’s our home. That’s where Garmin put a stake in the ground in 1989. We’ve grown substantially over the years, offering diverse products and global reach in 5 diverse markets. But some things won’t ever change: Our entrepreneurial spirit and a culture where everyone’s opinion matters. That’s because we believe it’s possible to light the tech world on fire and still be on a first name basis.

BIG IDEAS, SMALL EGOS
What we do best is make products that let our customers do what they love. To do that, we focus on practical innovation, never losing sight of the benefits our products bring to our customers. Sure, we love bells and whistles. What leading technology company doesn't? But we make sure ours have purpose. It’s not about the things we make. It’s about the things we make possible.

WE’RE GLOBAL, SERIOUSLY.
Yeah, we’re based in Kansas City, but we are truly a global company. With offices throughout Europe, Asia, Middle East, South America and Australia, our products are sold all over the world.

DREAM BIG. SLEEP WELL.
At Garmin, we like to encourage dreamers. But at some point it’s nice to wake up and enjoy a fully aware life. So we make it super easy to achieve a good balance between working, dreaming and enjoying life—from workout classes offered throughout the day, breaks to get out and move on our campus, and wellness programs offered throughout the year.

Our successful and multi-faceted therapeutic service model combines clean, modern housing with intensive supportive services that promote dignity and respectfully motivate our clients to achieve autonomy.

LifeMoves programs combat homelessness today – and tomorrow – by teaching comprehensive life skills that help our clients achieve long-term self-sufficiency, and effectively break the cycle of homelessness.

Our innovative and effective program model requires accountability from our clients. The LifeMoves program helps clients understand the root cause of their homelessness and then focuses them on developing core competencies and the skills they need to succeed for the long-term.

Similarly, our in-depth programming for children provides academic support to help bridge achievement gaps, and physical and mental health support to address the extensive issues caused by the trauma homelessness. The focus is on maximizing opportunities for homeless youth to help them mature into self-sufficient adults and to end intergenerational poverty which leads to homelessness.

Through these carefully designed programs – and with the support of 225 employees and 15,000 volunteers – LifeMoves is able to serve 9,636 homeless clients and provide 264,775 nights of shelter annually.

MAC works to position metro Atlanta as a top-tier global region by focusing on three key areas: economic development, public policy and promotion. Its efforts build on the qualities that make Atlanta one of the nation’s most unique metros — its neighborhoods, culture, quality of life, welcoming business community and more. 
 
MAC’s economic development efforts focus on recruiting new companies to the region and retaining and growing the innovative businesses that already call the area home. In addition, MAC convenes thought leaders in supply chain, IoT, bioscience, global commerce, technology, innovation and entrepreneurship — the region’s key ecosystems. 
 
MAC’s public policy efforts reflect the organization’s commitment to protect Georgia’s status as the number one state to do business. The organization engages in critical issues affecting the community, including transportation and transit, infrastructure, workforce development and education through a team of policy experts that also works to ensure Georgia remains a welcoming state that attracts talent from diverse backgrounds. 

MAC’s promotion efforts include robust marketing and communications that set metro Atlanta apart, in addition to initiatives like ChooseATL, which is working to attract and retain the next-generation talent shaping our region. Further, through MAC, the Atlanta Sports Council attracts and hosts the world’s top sporting events, such as the 2018 NCAA College Football Playoffs, Super Bowl LIII and the 2020 Final Four.

Ultimately, MAC strives to be a catalyst for a more prosperous and vibrant region, and its efforts continue to pay off. The region has transformed into a top tech market that is attracting next-generation talent. It’s true – metro Atlanta isn’t up and coming. It’s here, it’s now and it’s next.

Beholden to neither shareholders nor investors, Mozilla Corporation is wholly owned by the not-for-profit Mozilla Foundation.

Along with our communities of 20,000+ contributors and collaborators, Mozilla Corporation’s staff designs, builds, and distributes software that allows people to enjoy the internet on their own terms. Our flagship product — the Firefox browser — has expanded into a family of products that protects users and alerts them of risks. Mozilla’s Emerging Technologies group incubated and sponsors Rust — Stack Overflow’s “most loved programming language” for the last four years — and is building safe, private versions of virtual reality, internet of things, and voice recognition.

By maintaining a safe, open internet we're helping humanity, while also helping the individual humans employed here to reach their personal and professional goals.

Beholden to neither shareholders nor investors, Mozilla Corporation is wholly owned by the not-for-profit Mozilla Foundation.

Along with our communities of 20,000+ contributors and collaborators, Mozilla Corporation’s staff designs, builds, and distributes software that allows people to enjoy the internet on their own terms. Our flagship product — the Firefox browser — has expanded into a family of products that protects users and alerts them of risks. Mozilla’s Emerging Technologies group incubated and sponsors Rust — Stack Overflow’s “most loved programming language” for the last four years — and is building safe, private versions of virtual reality, internet of things, and voice recognition.

By maintaining a safe, open internet we're helping humanity, while also helping the individual humans employed here to reach their personal and professional goals.

Our culture is based on our values rooted in respect: respect for ourselves, respect for others, respect for diversity and respect for the future.

We can trace our origin back to 1866, when the first European condensed milk factory was opened in Cham, Switzerland, by the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company. One year later, Henri Nestlé, a trained pharmacist, launched one of the world’s first prepared infant cereals ‘Farine lactée’ in Vevey, Switzerland.

Today, we employ around 328,000 people and have factories or operations in almost every country in the world. With our headquarters still based in the Swiss town of Vevey, we had sales of CHF 89.5 billion in 2016.

Our portfolio covers almost every food and beverage category –offering products and services for all stages of life, every moment of the day, helping people care for themselves and their families.

New Hope was founded in 1979, when domestic violence services were virtually non-existent, New Hope’s founder, Edith Palmer, and a small group of volunteers established a hotline for survivors, taking turns answering calls forwarded to their homes. This single hotline expanded to include other critical services to help families achieve safety, such as an emergency shelter and counseling. However, the agency soon realized that if it was going to achieve the long-term goal of ending domestic violence, it needed to provide not only crisis intervention services, which respond to violence after it occurs, but also preventative and educational services to help survivors maintain their safety while gaining critical life skills and self sufficiency tools to help them fully overcome violence and become able to lead stable, independent and productive lives in the community.

In addition to Purdue University’s main campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, Purdue Polytechnic offers select degree programs in nine Indiana communities.

The academic programs combine theory-based applied learning, team-based projects, integrated humanities studies, competency-based credentialing, and a series of experiential components such as industry-sponsored senior capstone projects, internships, global immersions, and certification-earning activities. The Polytechnic learning experience is designed to produce graduates who not only have deep technical knowledge and applied skills in their chosen discipline, but also possess problem-solving, critical thinking, communications, and leadership skills sought by industries and communities.

Through the vision of Purdue University, the Purdue Polytechnic Institute, and the City of Indianapolis, the first Purdue Polytechnic High School will open in August, 2017, in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, with the mission to offer the best and most beneficial educational experience for students who want to pursue high-tech and STEM-related careers.

Whether delivering a transformed learning experience to produce industry-ready graduates who have the skills for today’s economy or conducting use-inspired research to advance the evolution of technology and solve real-world challenges, the Purdue Polytechnic Institute aims to be a global leader.

In addition to our own researchers, we also work closely with top physician-scientists and leading telemedicine companies.  S37 offers full support and end-to-end services for Networked Clinical Trials.  If you are an investigator, an inventor, a small biotech company or a large pharmaceutical company, we can help you achieve your clinical trial goals faster and easier than ever before.

Based in Los Angeles, we are focused on the development of networked patient-centric models for clinical research to rapidly accelerate biomedical discovery.  We leverage partnerships with national mobile nursing companies, pharmacy chains, patient advocacy groups, virtual e-consenting, mobile devices, and other technology companies to maximize efficiency.  Then, using design-thinking principles and rapid prototyping…S37 puts patients first and brings the best clinical trials right to their homes.  One incredible benefit of the S37 approach is that by making trials better for patients, we ultimately make the process of biomedical discovery faster and more efficient.  This means more safe and effective treatments will reach patients faster and cost less.

Our proprietary technology platform, NORA (Network-Oriented Research Assistant), bridges the gap between traditional trial management software, an EMR, and an advanced telemedicine platform to support all participants in Networked Clinical Trials (NCTs).

Would you believe we started out as a small chain of convenience stores? It's true. Way back in 1958. We were called Pronto Markets. In '67, our founder, the original Trader Joe, changed our name (yes, to Trader Joe's) and the way we do business.

We made the stores bigger (if you can imagine), decked the walls with cedar planks and donned our crew in cool Hawaiian shirts. Most importantly, we started putting innovative, hard-to-find, great-tasting foods in the ""Trader Joe's""​ name. That cut our costs and saved you money. Still does.

And that's important, because ""Value""​ is a concept we take very seriously. And by value we mean great everyday prices on all of our great products — no sales, no gimmicks, no clubs to join, no special cards to swipe... How do we do it?

- We buy direct from suppliers whenever possible, we bargain hard to get the best price, and then pass the savings on to you. 
- If an item doesn't pull its weight in our stores, it goes away to gangway for something else.
- We buy in volume and contract early to get the best prices. 
- Most grocers charge their suppliers fees for putting an item on the shelf. This results in higher prices... so we don't do it.
- We keep our costs low — because every penny we save is a penny you save.

People don’t associate us with journeys by river, on foot or via the air, but we help with that, too. Getting people to where they need to go has been our business over 100 years, and it shows. We’re leaders in our field, and no other city’s transport system is quite as recognisable: Red buses, black taxis, Tube trains and roundels have become icons in their own right. 

Our main job is to keep the city moving, working and growing but to do that, we have to listen. Constant improvements across the network are fuelled by feedback and comments from customers, as well as work within communities, representative groups, businesses and other London transport stakeholders. 

But our progress also depends on technology and data. With the future at our fingertips, we’ve already used it to revolutionise travel payments (think Oyster and contactless payment cards), and improved travel information.

People don’t associate us with journeys by river, on foot or via the air, but we help with that, too. Getting people to where they need to go has been our business over 100 years, and it shows. We’re leaders in our field, and no other city’s transport system is quite as recognisable: Red buses, black taxis, Tube trains and roundels have become icons in their own right. 

Our main job is to keep the city moving, working and growing but to do that, we have to listen. Constant improvements across the network are fuelled by feedback and comments from customers, as well as work within communities, representative groups, businesses and other London transport stakeholders. 

But our progress also depends on technology and data. With the future at our fingertips, we’ve already used it to revolutionise travel payments (think Oyster and contactless payment cards), and improved travel information. Tech and data is essential, not just to our future, but to others’: third parties use our data to power apps and services vital to customer journeys.
