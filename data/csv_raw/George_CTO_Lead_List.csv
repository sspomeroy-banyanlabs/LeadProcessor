Miller Group of Companies began on May 1, 1979, when Larry and Gail purchased their first dealership—Larry H. Miller Toyota in Murray, Utah. From that humble start, the Larry H. Miller Group of Companies has grown to employ more than 11,000 individuals at businesses located in 46 states. The areas of focus fall into five primary areas: automotive; sports and entertainment; finance and insurance; real estate; and philanthropy.

Miller Automotive Operations includes 65 dealerships in seven western states, representing 20 different automotive brands. The Group’s finance and insurance offerings include Total Care Auto Powered by Landcar, which offers consumers service and coverage contracts to protect and maintain their home and vehicle; and Prestige Financial, which provides financing solutions for dealerships and car buyers.

In 1985, Larry and Gail became co-owners of a struggling NBA franchise, the Utah Jazz. It was a big investment, but one they were willing to make. For the Jazz to thrive, the team needed a new venue, and Larry and Gail undertook the building of the Delta Center—now Vivint Smart Home Arena—a fixture in Salt Lake City.

The Millers soon added a collection of other businesses to the organization to strengthen the community and complement their existing businesses: MiLB Triple-A Salt Lake Bees; NBA D-League Salt Lake Stars; The Zone Sports Radio Network; Megaplex Theatres and more.

Several other businesses were established to support the work of the Group, such as Saxton Horne Communications, a full-service advertising and communications agency, and Larry H. Miller Real Estate, which manages the Group’s real estate holdings and construction projects.

On November 16, 2015, Gail Miller announced the appointment of the organization’s new 12-member board of directors consisting of family members, company officials, and outside business executives.",Retail,https://www.linkedin.com/company/6855577

Nearly 125 years ago, Alfred Harris of Niles, OH, created a faster printing press, solving a key industry problem and establishing the Harris Automatic Press Company. In the following decades, Harris built on that early innovation in printing and evolved into an electronic communications provider. As the space race accelerated, Harris, through the acquisition of Radiation Inc., became a leader in miniaturized electronic tracking and pulse code technology. It was in the 1970s that Harris Corporation relocated to Melbourne, FL, and began truly transforming itself into a global communications and information technology company.

L3 Technologies was originally created in 1997 as L3-Communications named for the three initials of founders Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta in partnership with Lehman Brothers. Lanza and LaPenta previously served in executive roles at Loral Corporation and Lockheed Martin, respectively. L3 was created through the divestiture of business segments following the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta. These business segments had originally been part of Loral Corporation and had been acquired by Lockheed in 1993.Under Lanza’s leadership, L3 experienced massive growth through a series of more than 100 acquisitions during its first 19 years. During some of its early days, the company completed an acquisition a month. The company changed its name to L3 Technologies in 2016 to more accurately describe its wider scope since its founding.

In 2019, Harris and L3 combined in a merger of equals to form L3 Harris Technologies, Inc. L3Harris Technologies is an agile global aerospace and defense technology innovator, delivering end-to-end solutions that meet customers’ mission-critical needs.

Nearly 125 years ago, Alfred Harris of Niles, OH, created a faster printing press, solving a key industry problem and establishing the Harris Automatic Press Company. In the following decades, Harris built on that early innovation in printing and evolved into an electronic communications provider. As the space race accelerated, Harris, through the acquisition of Radiation Inc., became a leader in miniaturized electronic tracking and pulse code technology. It was in the 1970s that Harris Corporation relocated to Melbourne, FL, and began truly transforming itself into a global communications and information technology company.

L3 Technologies was originally created in 1997 as L3-Communications named for the three initials of founders Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta in partnership with Lehman Brothers. Lanza and LaPenta previously served in executive roles at Loral Corporation and Lockheed Martin, respectively. L3 was created through the divestiture of business segments following the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta. These business segments had originally been part of Loral Corporation and had been acquired by Lockheed in 1993.Under Lanza’s leadership, L3 experienced massive growth through a series of more than 100 acquisitions during its first 19 years. During some of its early days, the company completed an acquisition a month. The company changed its name to L3 Technologies in 2016 to more accurately describe its wider scope since its founding.

In 2019, Harris and L3 combined in a merger of equals to form L3 Harris Technologies, Inc. L3Harris Technologies is an agile global aerospace and defense technology innovator, delivering end-to-end solutions that meet customers’ mission-critical needs.

Nearly 125 years ago, Alfred Harris of Niles, OH, created a faster printing press, solving a key industry problem and establishing the Harris Automatic Press Company. In the following decades, Harris built on that early innovation in printing and evolved into an electronic communications provider. As the space race accelerated, Harris, through the acquisition of Radiation Inc., became a leader in miniaturized electronic tracking and pulse code technology. It was in the 1970s that Harris Corporation relocated to Melbourne, FL, and began truly transforming itself into a global communications and information technology company.

L3 Technologies was originally created in 1997 as L3-Communications named for the three initials of founders Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta in partnership with Lehman Brothers. Lanza and LaPenta previously served in executive roles at Loral Corporation and Lockheed Martin, respectively. L3 was created through the divestiture of business segments following the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta. These business segments had originally been part of Loral Corporation and had been acquired by Lockheed in 1993.Under Lanza’s leadership, L3 experienced massive growth through a series of more than 100 acquisitions during its first 19 years. During some of its early days, the company completed an acquisition a month. The company changed its name to L3 Technologies in 2016 to more accurately describe its wider scope since its founding.

In 2019, Harris and L3 combined in a merger of equals to form L3 Harris Technologies, Inc. L3Harris Technologies is an agile global aerospace and defense technology innovator, delivering end-to-end solutions that meet customers’ mission-critical needs.

And we believe GE’s vision is best served by a business that knows the complexity, risk and potential of everything we offer customers — because we don’t only build it, we finance it, too. It’s more important than ever that the industries sustaining our lives get the support they deserve.

At GE Capital, we use the scale, intelligence and sheer inventiveness that’s in our DNA to do just that — whether it’s being the partner of choice for the first world or developing opportunities for the emerging world, we have the talent and the capability to make a better world anywhere we invest.

And that’s why GE Capital is different.

We’re more than a product or service. We create relationships that support the growth of every customer with whom we partner. We’re a team of the brightest minds in finance – with unmatchable expertise in the industries that matter most.

And we’ve got plans for the future.

They were open and revolutionary in their thinking—more than mere radicals, they dared to imagine a living and learning environment that would foster a community whose passion came from a deep sense of social justice.  

And it shows. 

UC Santa Cruz’s many accomplishments include: 
• The first to map the human genome and make it publicly available—for free, forever 
• Key contributors to the discovery of the Higgs Boson 
• The birthplace of organic farming
• The center of the Dickens Universe
• A graduate gaming program that is one of the top 10 in the country
• Ranked second in the world for its research impact

This university is not to be underestimated.

The campus's unique character is reflected in its students'​ bold choice to elect the fabled Banana Slug as its mascot—with their determined bearing and bright personality, it's hard to ignore Banana Slugs wherever they may roam.

And Banana Slug alumni are everywhere—a network 100,000-plus-strong, comprised of respected scientists, journalists, social activists, political and business leaders, artists, teachers, entrepreneurs, change-makers, and much more.

To achieve that mission, the Air Force has a vision of Global Vigilance, Reach and Power. That vision orbits around three core competencies: developing Airmen, technology to war fighting and integrating operations. These core competencies make our six distinctive capabilities possible.

Air and Space Superiority: With it, joint forces can dominate enemy operations in all dimensions: land, sea, air and space.

Global Attack: Because of technological advances, the Air Force can attack anywhere, anytime and do so quickly and with greater precision than ever before.

Rapid Global Mobility: Being able to respond quickly and decisively anywhere we're needed is key to maintaining rapid global mobility.

Precision Engagement: The essence lies in the ability to apply selective force against specific targets because the nature and variety of future contingencies demand both precise and reliable use of military power with minimal risk and collateral damage.

Information Superiority: The ability of joint force commanders to keep pace with information and incorporate it into a campaign plan is crucial.

Agile Combat Support: Deployment and sustainment are keys to successful operations and cannot be separated. Agile combat support applies to all forces, from those permanently based to contingency buildups to expeditionary",Defense & Space,https://www.linkedin.com/company/157235

Nearly 125 years ago, Alfred Harris of Niles, OH, created a faster printing press, solving a key industry problem and establishing the Harris Automatic Press Company. In the following decades, Harris built on that early innovation in printing and evolved into an electronic communications provider. As the space race accelerated, Harris, through the acquisition of Radiation Inc., became a leader in miniaturized electronic tracking and pulse code technology. It was in the 1970s that Harris Corporation relocated to Melbourne, FL, and began truly transforming itself into a global communications and information technology company.

L3 Technologies was originally created in 1997 as L3-Communications named for the three initials of founders Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta in partnership with Lehman Brothers. Lanza and LaPenta previously served in executive roles at Loral Corporation and Lockheed Martin, respectively. L3 was created through the divestiture of business segments following the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta. These business segments had originally been part of Loral Corporation and had been acquired by Lockheed in 1993.Under Lanza’s leadership, L3 experienced massive growth through a series of more than 100 acquisitions during its first 19 years. During some of its early days, the company completed an acquisition a month. The company changed its name to L3 Technologies in 2016 to more accurately describe its wider scope since its founding.

In 2019, Harris and L3 combined in a merger of equals to form L3 Harris Technologies, Inc. L3Harris Technologies is an agile global aerospace and defense technology innovator, delivering end-to-end solutions that meet customers’ mission-critical needs. The company provides advanced defense and commercial technologies across air, land, sea, space and cyber domains. ",Defense & Space,https://www.linkedin.com/company/40745219

The mission of PPLM is to protect and promote sexual and reproductive health and freedom of choice by providing clinical services, education and advocacy. Our vision is that sexual health is essential to every person's well-being.

Our Vision for the Future
At Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, we envision a future where sexual health is a personal and public health priority. We are working to normalize sexual health through our education programs and a public awareness campaign designed to get people talking about what sexual health is, what it means to be sexually healthy, and the changes we need to improve sexual health in our culture.
 
We strive to create an environment and culture in which it is normal for parents to talk with their kids about healthy behaviors around sex and sexuality; to encourage young people to seek regular preventive care to reduce disease and unintended pregnancy, and create an environment in which people regard sexual health as important to them, and to society at large.
 
We envision a future where there is universal understanding and support for the right of each person to responsibly manage his/her sexual and reproductive health. Women's freedom, equality and health will be enhanced by access to a full range of family planning options. When the right to family planning is accepted as fundamental and mainstream, there is the potential for each woman to fulfill her own dreams.
 
We envision a future where laws will guarantee these rights and ensure access to quality health care, education and advocacy services. These services will be readily available in safe settings that preserve and protect the privacy and rights of each individual regardless of income, age, marital status, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation.

Direct flights to Europe, South America, and Asia have made metro Atlanta easily accessible to the more than 1,000 international businesses that operate here and the more than 50 countries that have representation in the city through consulates, trade offices, and chambers of commerce.  The city has emerged as a banking center and is the world headquarters for 13 Fortune 500 companies.

Atlanta is the Capital city of the southeast, a city of the future with strong ties to its past.  The old in new Atlanta is the soul of the city, the heritage that enhances the quality of life in a contemporary city.  In the turbulent 60's, Atlanta was ""the city too busy to hate.""​  And today, in the 21st Century, Atlanta is the ""city not too busy to care""​.

For more than four decades Atlanta has been linked to the civil rights movement.  Civil Rights leaders moved forward, they were the visionaries who saw a new south, a new Atlanta.  They believed in peace. They made monumental sacrifices for that peace.  And because of them Atlanta became a fast-pace modern city which opened its doors to the 1996 Olympics.

Die-hard Southerners view Atlanta as the heart of the Old Confederacy; Atlanta has become the best example of the New South, a fast-paced modern city proud of its heritage.

In the past two decades Atlanta has experienced unprecedented growth -- the official city population remains steady, at about 420,000, but the metro population has grown in the past decade by nearly 40%, from 2.9 million to 4.1 million people.  A good measure of this growth is the ever-changing downtown skyline, along with skyscrapers constructed in the Midtown, Buckhead, and outer perimeter (fringing I-285) business districts.",Government Administration,https://www.linkedin.com/company/city-of-atlanta

AUTISM: We have the word Autism in our name to clearly identify the community we primarily serve and allow that community to easily identify and find us when seeking a care provider for their ASD needs. We do serve children with developmental needs other than Autism, but the vast majority of clients we serve are on the spectrum and, as such, our central mission is focused on serving the ASD community.

LEARNING: The word “Learning” refers to the science of Applied Behavioral Analysis being the science of learning across all areas of development. By having “Learning” in our name, we clearly acknowledge and convey that we are focused on the science of learning and its role in improving communication, social relationships, schooling and, ultimately, a positive work/life experience.

PARTNERS: Finally, the word “Partners” emphasizes how we think about our approach as a care delivery organization. Today, the community calls for a far more integrated approach in terms of communication, medical records and “partnerships” with other providers to support a more multi-disciplinary and comprehensive approach to care for clients and patients.

Drawing on our combined resources, CommonSpirit is dedicated to building healthy communities, advocating for the poor and vulnerable, and innovating how and where healing can happen—both inside our hospitals and out in the community.

We are doing this through the dedicated work of thousands of physicians, advanced practice clinicians, nurses, and staff; through clinical excellence delivered across a system of hospitals and other care centers covering 21 states and accessible to nearly one in four Americans; and through more than $4 billion annually in charity care, community benefits, and government program services.

The CommonSpirit name was inspired by scripture: ""Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.""Those words motivate and guide us every day. They celebrate the healing gift of compassion that God gives to us all, and they remind us of our calling to serve the common good.

Established in 1944 as a part of the United Nations system, the IMF's primary purpose is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system—the system of exchange rates and international payments that enables countries and their citizens to buy goods and services from each other. This is essential for sustainable economic growth and rising living standards.

To maintain stability and prevent crises in the international monetary system, the IMF conducts surveillance of national, regional, and global economic and financial developments. It provides advice to its 189 member countries, encouraging them to adopt policies that foster economic stability, reduce their vulnerability to economic and financial crises, and raise living standards. The IMF also serves as a forum where its global membership can discuss the national, regional, and global consequences of their policies.

The IMF makes financing temporarily available to member countries to help them address balance of payments problems—that is, when they find themselves short of foreign exchange to meet their payments to other countries.

Finally, the IMF provides countries with training to help them build the expertise and institutions they need for economic stability and growth. Supporting all of these activities is the institution's work in economic research and statistics.",International Trade and Development,https://www.linkedin.com/company/164420

Residential real estate, by contrast, remains stuck in a high-cost business model that pre-dates the Internet and remains stubbornly resistant to change. Harnessed properly, technology can help a lot – already, nearly 90% of consumers looking for a home go to sites like Zillow or Google to find and eventually select the properties that best suit their needs.

We created REX in 2015 to bring residential real estate into line with today’s expectations by using AI and big data to push past the outmoded practices of traditional real estate brokers to provide a superior outcome for both buyers and sellers at one-third the cost. So how does REX do it? We use data modeling and machine learning to match sellers and buyers of homes as accurately and speedily as possible on Zillow, Google, Facebook and more. And by doing that, we can reduce costs for all involved - REX covers both sides of the transaction instead of the 5-6% charged by traditional brokers.

Unlike traditional brokers, REX licensed agents are salaried and incentivized to satisfy customers rather than to just close transactions in pursuit of a fast commission. Our team partners with sellers and buyers from listing to close, and shares with them the information they need via an easy-to-use web dashboard. REX is uniquely designed to simplify all of the moving parts, helping consumers with escrow, titling, service connections, mortgage and insurance shopping and keeps securely in the hands of the buyers and sellers all of the data related to the home and legal and financial information related to the transactions.

The center manages many of NASA's Earth observation, astronomy, planetary science and astrophysics missions.

NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is home to the nation's largest organization of scientists, engineers and technologists who build spacecraft, instruments and new technology to study Earth, the sun, our solar system and the universe.

Just outside Washington, Goddard is home to Hubble operations and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. Goddard manages communications between mission control and orbiting astronauts aboard the International Space Station. Goddard scientists stare into the sun, grind up meteorites for signs of life's building blocks, look into the farthest reaches of space, and untangle the mysteries of our own changing world. Goddard engineers construct sensitive instruments, build telescopes that peer into the cosmos, and operate the test chambers that ensure those satellites' survival.

Named for American rocketry pioneer Dr. Robert H. Goddard, the center was established May 1, 1959, as NASA's first space flight complex. Goddard and its several installations are critical in carrying out NASA's missions of space exploration and scientific discovery.

Goddard encompasses several other NASA properties, most significantly:

• Wallops Flight Facility near Chincoteague, Virginia
• Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility in Fairmont, West Virginia
• Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City

Our goal is to close the gaps in opportunity and achievement that consign far too many young people—especially those from low-income families or who are black, Latino, or American Indian—to lives on the margins of the American mainstream.

Although many organizations speak up for the adults employed by schools and colleges, we speak up for students, especially those whose needs and potential are often overlooked. We evaluate every policy, every practice, and every dollar spent through a single lens: what is right for students.

We work alongside educators, parents, students, policymakers, and civic and business leaders in communities across the country, providing practical assistance in their efforts to transform schools and colleges into institutions that serve all students well.  

We analyze local, state, and national data and use what we learn to help build broader understanding of achievement and opportunity gaps and the actions necessary to close them.  

We participate actively in national and state policy debates, bringing lessons learned from on-the-ground work and from unflinching data analyses to build the case for policies that will help all students and schools reach high levels of achievement.

Our Core Beliefs:
We believe in the power of education to close the gaps that separate low-income students and students of color from other young Americans. 

We believe that schools and colleges, appropriately organized, can help virtually all students master the knowledge they need to succeed.  

We believe long-standing gaps in opportunity, achievement, and attainment have roots inside and outside of schools. And though we know these gaps are stubborn, we also know they are not inevitable.  

We believe a strong education improves the lives of young people, is vital to sustaining our democracy, and strengthens America.",Government Administration,https://www.linkedin.com/company/education-trust

The first P.C. Richard opened on September 26, 1909 in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. This particular store sold hardware and was run by Peter Christiään Richard, an immigrant from Holland. The first electronic appliance the store sold was an electronic iron. His son, Alfred J. Richard, would spend all of his time helping his father, as he quit school at the age of fourteen for the sake of the store, which at that point was located in Queens. Within time, A.J. would become the head of the store, and would prove to be highly successful in persuading people to buy appliances. As the years progressed, his sons would aid him with the business, as they expanded to other locations. To this day, the chain is still run by the Richard family, as A.J. himself would serve as chairman well into his 90's.",Retail,https://www.linkedin.com/company/pc-richard-&-son

Precision Engagement: The essence lies in the ability to apply selective force against specific targets because the nature and variety of future contingencies demand both precise and reliable use of military power with minimal risk and collateral damage.

Information Superiority: The ability of joint force commanders to keep pace with information and incorporate it into a campaign plan is crucial.

We perform more dental implant procedures every year than any other facility or network because of our innovative approach to treating patients. That level of experience has given thousands of patients the confidence to take that first step towards a better smile.

Our team of doctors and specialists work together to deliver excellent treatment to our patients. We believe that when the doctor speaks directly with the oral surgeon and the lab technician, face-to-face, our team is able to deliver a better patient experience. Every ClearChoice doctor goes through a rigorous screening process to make sure that they will uphold our strict standards of quality. We look for doctors with experience and excellence in treating their patients. We believe that our dedicated team of professionals, with a specific focus on just dental implants, is a key strength of the ClearChoice Dental Implant centers.

Before ClearChoice, it was difficult to know the full price of dental implant procedures. Different specialists had different fees that would add up at each stage in the process. Since our doctors, technicians, and labs are all on site, we are able to give a single price for the entire procedure from start to finish. There are no surprise fees and no hidden costs. After your consultation, you will know exactly what it will cost to complete your dental implant treatment.

Traditionally, dental implants require several visits to specialists in several locations, and the teeth are created at an off-site lab and shipped to the office. If any adjustments needed to be made, the teeth would need to be shipped back to the lab. At ClearChoice, we have combined all of the necessary elements for successful dental implant treatment in a single location.

In many rural areas the New York State Police is today, as it was at the time of its establishment in 1917, the principal — sometimes only — department providing police services to the public. In other areas it shares jurisdiction and works cooperatively with local agencies. This is accomplished by making available to local departments the full range of State Police specialized units, scientific and criminal investigative services, and other resources smaller departments typically cannot sustain themselves.

The datacenter of today is very different than the datacenter of yesterday, and we think the datacenter of tomorrow is just around the corner. We're writing software to take you all the way from yesterday to today, and then safely to tomorrow and beyond.

Physical, virtual, containers. Private cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS. Windows, Linux, Mac. These are just some of the choices faced when architecting a datacenter of today. And the choice is not one or the other; instead, it is often a combination of many of these.

HashiCorp builds tools to ease these decisions by presenting solutions that span the gaps. Our tools manage both physical machines and virtual machines, Windows, and Linux, SaaS and IaaS, etc. And we're committed to supporting next-generation technologies, as well.

HashiCorp was founded and continues to be run by the primary authors of all our core technologies powering thousands of companies worldwide. We speak at conferences and write books related to application and infrastructure management.

All our foundational technologies are open source and developed openly, and have been since 2010.

The Tao of HashiCorp is the foundation that guides our vision, roadmap, and product design. As you evaluate using or contributing to HashiCorp's products, it may be valuable to understand the motivations and intentions for our work.

How we do it is a longer story. 

It starts with our cloud-based Product Lifecycle Excellence platform. More than 1000 of the world’s most innovative and highly regulated companies use it to improve quality and stay in compliance at every step of their product journey – from concept to commercialization. 

We have more than 500 employees who come to work every single day with a singular focus: to help our customers improve quality. We do it in many ways. And we can do it for you. 

We’ll help you build quality into your product design processes. You’ll get a streamlined system to track clinical trials, organize the data, and submit results for approval by regulatory agencies around the world. 

You can digitize, automate and accelerate quality processes to build a culture of quality throughout your organization. Increase visibility and ensure compliance throughout your supply chain. And help your manufacturing teams eliminate the tradeoffs between line performance and product quality. 
Once your product is out in the market we give you the ability to manage in-market complaints and close the quality loop. 

In other words, we help you make quality a priority throughout your company. And that’s important. Because when you’re trying to impact people’s lives, quality changes everything.

We are owners and operators who are deeply rooted in our assets. Our in-depth knowledge of local markets, as well as our extensive real asset and capital markets expertise, enable us to develop prolific deal flow and to deploy active asset management and monitoring across our business lines.

Our “owner-operator” perspective generates deep capabilities to understand assets and source less-than-fully-marketed deal flow from industry participants. Targeting acquisitions and loans in growth markets where we maintain a strong local operating footprint, but which are less crowded and offer more opportunities for value-add investments, allows us to build portfolios of investments individually asset by asset and exit at portfolio level premiums. 

Our asset management strategy is specialized and focused in a way that emphasizes current income and capital appreciation while mitigating risk. By making improvements that build lasting communities, increase renter satisfaction, and ultimately bring value to investors, we seek to “create alpha” at the asset level.

The principals of Bridge have been investing in and improving communities around the country in one form or another since 1991 and manage private equity funds, separately managed vehicles, co-investments, and joint ventures.

In order to truly serve both shippers and carriers, Arrive decided early on to aggressively invest in what drives results. On July 14, 2014, Arrive was Born.

Arrive has been focused on one thing since its founding: Raising the standard of what it means to be a broker. Our strongest asset is our carrier side, with 400+ employees whose only job is to build relationships with carriers and enter their equipment into our proprietary system. In a market where most brokers rely on load boards competing for the same capacity, our model separates us. Our carriers receive an unprecedented amount of financial and technological support, allowing Arrive to provide our shipping partners with exceptional service and unique capacity. Our team members are trained to see the world through the eyes of our customers. We are not simply in the logistics business, we are invested in your business -- and focused on using our talent and technology to help it grow.

We are very proud of what we have accomplished since 2014. What was once a 10-person team in a small office in Austin, TX is now a tribe of more than 1000 colleagues working out of Austin, Chicago, and Chattanooga. Reaching $30 million in truckload sales during our first year in business validated our theory that shippers want more out of their supply chain partners. Generating over $60 million in truckload sales in 2016 only continued to drive that point home for us.  As a result of our commitment to service, we closed 2017 by generating $145 million.  We are not slowing down, in 2018 we ended the year with $370M in revenue We will not stop raising the standard. We will be doubling in size for the fifth consecutive year in 2019 and are projected to generate over $600 million.",Logistics and Supply Chain,https://www.linkedin.com/company/3817357

We don’t just want to be another multiplex. Everyone who works at Alamo Drafthouse, from the managers to the servers to the kitchen staff, is passionate about film.

To us, the latest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe can be just as worthy of attention and celebration as a foreign language drama. Through our Drafthouse Recommends program we've committed ourselves to helping innovative and challenging films like GET OUT, THE FLORIDA PROJECT,  and CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, and find an audience.

Celebrating classic cinema is also something we take seriously. Whether it’s an interactive Movie Party presentation of a timeless classic, a chef-inspired feast with a menu paired to a film, or a re-evaluation of a lost gem, we love sharing the movies we love with Alamo Drafthouse audiences of all ages.

When you see a movie at Alamo Drafthouse, you get cold drinks, delicious meals and tasty local beers, brought to your seat by a server. Need a free refill on your popcorn or soda? Raise an order card and we’ll get it taken care of quickly.

Each Alamo Drafthouse's menu has food, snacks & dessert prepared fresh from locally sourced ingredients. Plus, our chefs regularly create special menus inspired by classic cinema and big upcoming blockbusters, like an all-Pakistani menu curated by Kumail Nanjiani for THE BIG SICK or a take on African flavors for BLACK PANTHER.

Beer is our middle name at Alamo Drafthouse, so we make certain that every Alamo Drafthouse location highlights and promotes the best local craft breweries. Our bar staff also loves to innovate, and are constantly mixing up new cocktail creations that’ll elevate the cinematic experience.",Entertainment,https://www.linkedin.com/company/523695

DELIVERING BREAKTHROUGH, SCALABLE AND INTERCONNECTED SOLUTIONS

With offices in California, Shanghai and Hong Kong, Credo delivers breakthrough Serializer-Deserializer (SerDes) IP and interconnect solutions that scale bandwidth and deliver end-to-end signal integrity in next-generation platforms requiring single-lane rate 25G, 50G, and 100G connectivity.  As big data, cloud and mobility applications put increased pressure on network infrastructure, Credo enables customers to overcome the growing design hurdle associated with rapidly and exponentially scaling network bandwidth. Each member of the Credo management team respectively has over 20 years of semiconductor-relevant expertise. We’re on the pulse of modern technology and have monitored its evolution to inform our engineering and strategic approaches.

Credo was privately-funded until 2015 when it received its first round of Series A funding which was lead by Walden International. Since its inception, Credo has consistently delivered breakthroughs in SerDes technology including the delivery of the industry’s first CMOS 50G SerDes IP based on NRZ modulation, as well as the delivery of the industry’s first CMOS 100G PAM4. Credo's unique, patented mixed signal architecture is the foundation for its high performance and low power at these accelerated bandwidth rates.  In fact, Credo delivered the 50G NRZ in 40nm and the 100G PAM4 in 28nm.  Others in the industry have moved to power hungry DSP approaches and are struggling to meet the fundamental power requirements even in the most advanced silicon processing geometry's.",Semiconductors,https://www.linkedin.com/company/3034982

If you think you know State Auto, think again. 
 
Since 1921, we’ve grown from just $15,000 in assets to a $3 billion organization. We’ve been innovators since day one, when we were founded out of a desire to do things differently. To treat customers better, offer those customers flexibility, and, years later, to use technology to make agents’ jobs easier. That spirit of innovation is at the heart of our success, as is our deep commitment to people – our independent agents, our customers, our associates and the communities in which we live and work.
 
Today’s State Auto is a 21st century technology and transformation company. We are risk takers. Creators. Innovators. We love new ideas and we’re passionate about serving our customers and communities. We listen to our customers and to each other. And we deliver. That’s not what people expect from an insurance company. But that’s what they expect from State Auto.

At GE Capital, we use the scale, intelligence and sheer inventiveness that’s in our DNA to do just that — whether it’s being the partner of choice for the first world or developing opportunities for the emerging world, we have the talent and the capability to make a better world anywhere we invest.

And that’s why GE Capital is different.

We’re more than a product or service. We create relationships that support the growth of every customer with whom we partner. We’re a team of the brightest minds in finance – with unmatchable expertise in the industries that matter most.

And we’ve got plans for the future.

The new GE Capital is aligned with GE’s industrial businesses to bring customers cutting edge financial solutions as our company continues to build, move, power and cure the world.

AURIGO (OR-e-go)

Just like Worcester and Kissimmee, our company name tends to get mispronounced on the first read. Aurigo is pronounced OR-e-go. Put a big emphasis on the ‘OR’ at the beginning and let the rest flow lightly from there.

Our name is derived from Auriga, a constellation that lies in the Northern Hemisphere and means “the charioteer” in Latin. In Greek mythology, Auriga is usually depicted as a charioteer, holding the reins of a chariot with his right hand while carrying a goat and his two young kids on his left arm, always moving forward. With a play on the word GO in Aurigo we have taken this idea of movement, acceleration, progression, innovation, and advancement, and extended it into our name, methodology and company spirit.",Computer Software,https://www.linkedin.com/company/aurigo-software-technologies

And today, Vallejo continues to be a friendly, active waterfront community that attracts innovative and hardworking people and businesses. This is reflected in Vallejo being ranked the hottest real estate market in the United States for the past twelve months.

The City of Vallejo's story begins in 1844 when General Mariano G. Vallejo saw the promise of the area. Named after him and twice the site of the state capitol in the 1850s, Vallejo grew into an important shipping and naval center. Legend has it that Mare Island got its name after Gen. Vallejo drove a herd of horses across the Carquinez Strait.

Established in 1854, Mare Island Naval Shipyard was the West Coast's first shipyard. Decommissioned in 1996, Mare Island is now home to more than 100 businesses and has become an industrial, commercial and residential engine for the Bay Area.

A strong economy and affordable housing have meant new prosperity for Vallejo, as businesses and residents come to the city. Some are attracted by the beautifully restored Victorian homes and business fronts; others by the newer homes in the Northgate and Hiddenbrooke developments.

The city recently earned Main Street designation, and as a result our downtown area has benefited from on-site training in effective commercial district revitalization, technical assistance, consulting services, networking activities, and site assessments from California Main Street.

Waterfront and Mare Island redevelopment have become a community effort, with input from residents helping shape the future of what will become the most important economic generators for the city.

The city's Ferry Terminal and ferry services have served as a model for the rest of the Bay Area, helping make Vallejo a transportation and commuter hub for the North Bay with over 1 million riders annually. Six Flags Marine World, restaurants and the Downtown Farmer's Market help make Vallejo the vibrant community it is today.",Government Administration,https://www.linkedin.com/company/51485

We’re a thriving team of scientists, engineers, designers, supply chain experts, customer service and business professionals who believe that design, technology and out-of-the-box thinking are the keys to creating the alternative to cigarettes. 

PRODUCT

Launched in 2015, JUUL is the number one nicotine vaporizer in the United States, selling over twenty million JUULpods a month and growing fast. Headquartered in San Francisco and backed by leading technology investors including Fidelity Investments and Tao Invest LLC, JUUL Labs is disrupting one of the world’s largest and oldest industries.

REVOLUTIONARY THINKING

Adam Bowen and James Monsees co-founded JUUL Labs when they applied their background in product design to the challenge of finding a true alternative to smoking. They had been smokers for many years, but when they could find no acceptable alternative to cigarettes, Adam and James recognized a groundbreaking opportunity to apply industrial design to the smoking industry, which had not materially evolved in over one hundred years. 

As smokers, they knew a true alternative to cigarettes would have to offer a nicotine level found in no other alternative on the market. It would also have to invite its own ritual. The result was JUUL.

OUR COMMITMENT

We recognize that smoking alternatives continue to be the subject of conversation. We welcome dialogue, debate and data, and will register and publish results from vapor-related research we conduct.

OUR INTENT

We believe JUUL is the first viable alternative for adult smokers. Those who don’t currently use nicotine products should not start.

Of the $83 billion spent on digital this year, Google and Facebook account for 60 cents of every dollar. The result? Massive investment, overabundant data and rising expectations for better results.

Here's the problem. The lead process is wasteful. For every 6% in conversion success, 94% goes nowhere. Ads on the wrong channel, messaging that doesn't land, and potential leads that lack consistent follow-up—if any at all.

Even if you get your funnel performing, everyone knows that not all customers are created equal. It's tough to land new customers, but even harder to find the right ones—the profitable ones.

The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) is an agency within the Texas Health and Human Services System. In September 2016, Texas began transforming how it delivers health and human services to qualified Texans, with a goal of making the Health and Human Services System more efficient and effective. Sept. 1, 2017, marked another major milestone in this transformation.

The new accountable, restructured system:
- Makes it easier for people to find out about the services or benefits for which 
  they may qualify.
- Better integrates programs by removing bureaucratic silos and grouping similar 
  programs and services together.
- Creates clear lines of accountability within the organization.
- Includes well-defined and objective performance metrics for all organizational 
  areas.

Texas Health and Human Services now consists of 2 agencies: the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). HHS is headquartered in Austin, TX. Dr. Courtney Phillips began serving as the system’s Executive Commissioner in October 2018.

With his world-renowned team of scientists & product developers, the KISS founder’s passion is to invent DIY beauty products that save women a tremendous amount of time, effort and money.

Empowering women to “bring the salon home” and express their personal style, on their terms, is the KISS WAY since day one, and it has thrived beautifully over the past 30 years.

Among many notable KISS accomplishments, the first DIY glue on artificial nail was met with rave reviews, but by far, the company’s shining star is the press-on nail. Featuring patented SuperHold technology and an amazing gel finish, this innovation literally revolutionized the beauty industry, giving women the ability to complete a much sought after gel mani, in minutes, with reliably long-lasting results.

KISS is also a major player in the false eyelash business. In fact, new technology and styling methods and trend-setting designs have made KISS a market leader in lashes, with a huge customer and celebrity fan base.

Not because we’re the biggest dealer group in the region, but because we’re the best in all the ways that matter to our customers.

With 27 new vehicle franchises operating from 22 showrooms throughout Greater Pittsburgh, we proudly provide the unparalleled value and selection that generations of car buyers have come to expect from us. Yet we’re committed to constantly finding new ways to rise above and beyond those expectations.

We do this because we believe buying a vehicle is more than just a transaction. It’s an experience that begins long before you walk into one of our showrooms, and a relationship that lasts long after you leave.

This philosophy, and feedback from consumers on what the perfect car buying experience should be, led Rob Cochran to develop Clearly Better Car Buying. It’s been called the most innovative change in the regional auto landscape in decades and continues to win over customers in waves.

As the only auto retailer to be named a Pittsburgh Top Workplace every year since the award’s inception, we proudly employ more than 1100 team members.

Whether you buy from us or work with us, our #1 goal is to make sure that your experience is stellar from start to finish.

NuScale Power is developing a new modular light water reactor to supply reliable and abundant carbon-free nuclear energy. Our groundbreaking small modular reactor (SMR) design features a fully fabricated NuScale Power Module™ capable of generating 60 MW of electricity using a safer, smaller, scalable version of pressurized water reactor technology.

NuScale’s SMR technology performs as clean as wind and solar, and cleaner than any fossil fuel. It is ideally suited across diverse platforms including base load electricity, load-following support for renewables, very high-reliability micro-grids, and process heat or steam for district heating, desalination, and other industrial uses. Adaptable to changing consumer demand and resilient to changing weather conditions, NuScale SMRs are the perfect companion to renewables that face intermittent generation capability. 

A NuScale power plant can house up to 12 SMRs for a total facility output of up to 720 megawatts (gross). The SMR design is scalable, allowing customers to incrementally increase facility output to match demand. It is also flexible, providing significant opportunities to reduce the financial commitments and overall production costs normally associated with giga-watt size nuclear facilities, including the amount of required staff because of the SMR’s unparalleled safety features. 

At NuScale, our commitment to safety is second to none. Smarter, more cost-effective, and simplified, our advanced SMR design eliminates two-thirds of previously required safety systems and components found in today’s large reactors. This Triple Crown For Nuclear Plant Safety™ design safely shuts down and self-cools, indefinitely with no operator action, no AC or DC power, and no additional water. It is the first self-protecting reactor.",Oil & Energy,https://www.linkedin.com/company/nuscale-power

The Company expanded slowly until the 1980s, when it began to grow rapidly through acquisition and new store openings. In 1982, Sally moved its corporate headquarters to Denton, Texas following the acquisition of a Denton-based chain. 

In 1985, Sally acquired a major full-service (professional only) beauty supply distributor servicing the Midwestern United States. The growth of the full-service business led to the formation of the company now known as Beauty Systems Group LLC, focusing on distribution solely to the professional trade. 

New store openings and acquisitions continue to guide Sally’s expansion. In 1987, Sally became an international company with the acquisition of an affiliate in the United Kingdom.  Today, Sally and its affiliates operate over 4500 stores throughout the United States and the world. Our international operations now extend to the United Kingdom, continental Europe, Puerto Rico, Canada, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Mexico.  Both Sally Beauty Supply and Beauty Systems Group have successful and growing online (e-commerce) businesses.

In 2006, Sally became a publicly held company with its shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Sally and its affiliates have long been industry leaders.  Expertise in professional product merchandising, distribution and education provides the basis for a commanding presence in the global market. This, combined with strong domestic growth and international development, positions the companies for anticipated continuing success in future years. 

All subsidiaries and affiliates share Sally’s customer-driven operating philosophy and vision.",Retail,https://www.linkedin.com/company/23337

⇨ We sweat the day-to-day details. From discovery through daily life after implementation, the same team works tirelessly to ensure error-free benefits.

⇨ We protect you from the unknown. Our dedicated account managers tackle compliance updates, adjust for changing regulations and stop errors before they happen.

Every year, while Americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. We seek to eliminate those fees and put money back into workers’ hands. 
Our financial system doesn’t work for people. But Earnin does. Earnin is an app that lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. App users can receive their money in their bank account instantly at little or no cost — as we operate on a pay what you choose model. All they need is a bank account and a job that provides direct deposit or uses electronic timesheets.   
At Earnin we’re building the way we think a financial system should work for everyone, not just the people who can afford it. We help people take control of their money and get to a better financial place.
Our goal is not only to provide great products at little or no cost to the people who need them but also to inspire kindness across the financial world and eventually across all industries.

We’re creating this future by digitising Britain’s energy infrastructure. The secure wireless network we’ve built connects smart meters in homes and businesses to customer’s energy suppliers and network operators across Great Britain. 

A single, secure network will mean energy companies can deliver their services to customers more efficiently and so drive down costs. And a smarter, connected home can enable energy efficiency, helping move Britain to a low carbon economy. 

Our network will also support the Ofgem-led transformation programme to deliver faster, more reliable switching energy for consumers. Encouraging greater competition, consumers will be able to switch their energy supply within 24 hours. 
 
Before our network was built, millions of first generation smart meters (known as SMETS1) had been installed.  DCC are also working hard to migrate first generation smart meters to our network, so energy consumers will be able to switch energy supplier without losing smart functionality in their device. 
 
Our secure network opens up boundless opportunities for innovators within and beyond the energy industry. It could be used to support a national network of charging points for electric vehicles, facilitate smart buildings, smart cities, environmental monitoring and support adjacent markets. By enabling new products and services we will help build a carbon neutral Britain and through it’s re-use, bring down the cost of accessing the network to all of our customers.

We’re creating this future by digitising Britain’s energy infrastructure. The secure wireless network we’ve built connects smart meters in homes and businesses to customer’s energy suppliers and network operators across Great Britain. 

A single, secure network will mean energy companies can deliver their services to customers more efficiently and so drive down costs. And a smarter, connected home can enable energy efficiency, helping move Britain to a low carbon economy. 

Our network will also support the Ofgem-led transformation programme to deliver faster, more reliable switching energy for consumers. Encouraging greater competition, consumers will be able to switch their energy supply within 24 hours. 
 
Before our network was built, millions of first generation smart meters (known as SMETS1) had been installed.  DCC are also working hard to migrate first generation smart meters to our network, so energy consumers will be able to switch energy supplier without losing smart functionality in their device. 
 
Our secure network opens up boundless opportunities for innovators within and beyond the energy industry. It could be used to support a national network of charging points for electric vehicles, facilitate smart buildings, smart cities, environmental monitoring and support adjacent markets. By enabling new products and services we will help build a carbon neutral Britain and through it’s re-use, bring down the cost of accessing the network to all of our customers.  

We’re already talking to some of the UK’s most innovative businesses about the potential of our network. Imagine what you could do with it. ",Information Technology and Services,https://www.linkedin.com/company/smart-dcc-ltd

Since 1994, the business has pivoted and grown from shareware to wholesale domain name registration to retail domain name registration to mobile phone service to symmetrical Gigabit Internet service via fiber-to-the-premises. Today, Tucows employs over 400 people and services millions of customers around the world.

Ting Mobile disrupted the US cellphone industry in 2012, offering shockingly fair pricing, usable interfaces and no-hold, no-transfer live customer support. About six months after launch, GigaOM included us, along with Apple, Samsung, FitBit and Waze, in The Mobile 15 as one of fifteen companies “…that are changing or could potentially change the mobile landscape.” In 2015 and 2016, we beat Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and every other provider in the annual Consumer Reports survey of US cell phone services. In just over four years, we operate on two nationwide networks, have over 200,000 active devices and generate over 50 million dollars in annual revenue.

Ting Internet launched in the US in 2015. In December 2015, Gizmodo listed us as one of The 6 Best Things That Happened to the Internet This Year. We are investing millions in fiber networks and partnering with small towns to change what people expect from their Internet service and their Internet service provider. We have already launched Gigabit speed Internet service in Charlottesville, Virginia, Westminster, Maryland and Holly Springs, North Carolina and we just announced that we will be coming to Centennial, Colorado.

OpenSRS was the first wholesale domain name registrar when it launched in 1999 and is now the largest in the world, managing nearly 15 million domain names and millions of value-added services through a global reseller network of over 13,000 web hosts and ISPs across six continents.

Hover makes it easy for individuals and small businesses to manage their domain names and email addresses. Our easy-to-use management tools and extraordinary customer support earned us top mention in Lifehacker’s Five Best Domain Name Registrars and, more importantly, regularly delights over 250,000 customers.

We’re creating this future by digitising Britain’s energy infrastructure. The secure wireless network we’ve built connects smart meters in homes and businesses to customer’s energy suppliers and network operators across Great Britain. 

A single, secure network will mean energy companies can deliver their services to customers more efficiently and so drive down costs. And a smarter, connected home can enable energy efficiency, helping move Britain to a low carbon economy. 

Our network will also support the Ofgem-led transformation programme to deliver faster, more reliable switching energy for consumers. Encouraging greater competition, consumers will be able to switch their energy supply within 24 hours. 
 
Before our network was built, millions of first generation smart meters (known as SMETS1) had been installed.  DCC are also working hard to migrate first generation smart meters to our network, so energy consumers will be able to switch energy supplier without losing smart functionality in their device. 
 
Our secure network opens up boundless opportunities for innovators within and beyond the energy industry. It could be used to support a national network of charging points for electric vehicles, facilitate smart buildings, smart cities, environmental monitoring and support adjacent markets. By enabling new products and services we will help build a carbon neutral Britain and through it’s re-use, bring down the cost of accessing the network to all of our customers.  

We’re already talking to some of the UK’s most innovative businesses about the potential of our network. Imagine what you could do with it. ",Information Technology and Services,https://www.linkedin.com/company/smart-dcc-ltd

Since 1994, the business has pivoted and grown from shareware to wholesale domain name registration to retail domain name registration to mobile phone service to symmetrical Gigabit Internet service via fiber-to-the-premises. Today, Tucows employs over 400 people and services millions of customers around the world.

Ting Mobile disrupted the US cellphone industry in 2012, offering shockingly fair pricing, usable interfaces and no-hold, no-transfer live customer support. About six months after launch, GigaOM included us, along with Apple, Samsung, FitBit and Waze, in The Mobile 15 as one of fifteen companies “…that are changing or could potentially change the mobile landscape.” In 2015 and 2016, we beat Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and every other provider in the annual Consumer Reports survey of US cell phone services. In just over four years, we operate on two nationwide networks, have over 200,000 active devices and generate over 50 million dollars in annual revenue.

Ting Internet launched in the US in 2015. In December 2015, Gizmodo listed us as one of The 6 Best Things That Happened to the Internet This Year. We are investing millions in fiber networks and partnering with small towns to change what people expect from their Internet service and their Internet service provider. We have already launched Gigabit speed Internet service in Charlottesville, Virginia, Westminster, Maryland and Holly Springs, North Carolina and we just announced that we will be coming to Centennial, Colorado.

OpenSRS was the first wholesale domain name registrar when it launched in 1999 and is now the largest in the world, managing nearly 15 million domain names and millions of value-added services through a global reseller network of over 13,000 web hosts and ISPs across six continents.

Hover makes it easy for individuals and small businesses to manage their domain names and email addresses. Our easy-to-use management tools and extraordinary customer support earned us top mention in Lifehacker’s Five Best Domain Name Registrars and, more importantly, regularly delights over 250,000 customers.

Since 1994, the business has pivoted and grown from shareware to wholesale domain name registration to retail domain name registration to mobile phone service to symmetrical Gigabit Internet service via fiber-to-the-premises. Today, Tucows employs over 400 people and services millions of customers around the world.

Ting Mobile disrupted the US cellphone industry in 2012, offering shockingly fair pricing, usable interfaces and no-hold, no-transfer live customer support. About six months after launch, GigaOM included us, along with Apple, Samsung, FitBit and Waze, in The Mobile 15 as one of fifteen companies “…that are changing or could potentially change the mobile landscape.” In 2015 and 2016, we beat Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and every other provider in the annual Consumer Reports survey of US cell phone services. In just over four years, we operate on two nationwide networks, have over 200,000 active devices and generate over 50 million dollars in annual revenue.

Ting Internet launched in the US in 2015. In December 2015, Gizmodo listed us as one of The 6 Best Things That Happened to the Internet This Year. We are investing millions in fiber networks and partnering with small towns to change what people expect from their Internet service and their Internet service provider. We have already launched Gigabit speed Internet service in Charlottesville, Virginia, Westminster, Maryland and Holly Springs, North Carolina and we just announced that we will be coming to Centennial, Colorado.

OpenSRS was the first wholesale domain name registrar when it launched in 1999 and is now the largest in the world, managing nearly 15 million domain names and millions of value-added services through a global reseller network of over 13,000 web hosts and ISPs across six continents.

Hover makes it easy for individuals and small businesses to manage their domain names and email addresses. Our easy-to-use management tools and extraordinary customer support earned us top mention in Lifehacker’s Five Best Domain Name Registrars and, more importantly, regularly delights over 250,000 customers.
