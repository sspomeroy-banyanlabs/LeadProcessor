Acai bowls are the latest craze in healthy eating. Fresche is a quick serve restaurant that specializes in blended frozen fruit bowls, topped with fresh fruit, granola and other super-food add-ins. We don't add ice so the consistency is thick and smooth. (Like a smoothie in a bowl with toppings). Our focus is serving whole, healthy, great tasting food. Fresche is a place that your body can trust, and your taste buds will demand. Fresche acai bowls are lower in sugar, dairy free, with gluten free options.

Vegan, Vegetarian, Paleo and Diabetic friendly. Just let us know what your preference is.   

Fresche matches up well with the growing trend of consumers who are demanding truly healthy food options. Many restaurants claim to have healthy menu items, when in reality they are not.  Thrive! is a place that leaves you feeling good about what you have fueled your body with.  

If you are looking for acai bowls in Tempe, Mesa, Scottsdale or Phoenix, it is worth the drive!

Because of our passion for natural wellness we have researched and found high quality, whole food supplements and proteins that we are excited to offer here at Fresche.

Acai bowls are the latest craze in healthy eating. Fresche is a quick serve restaurant that specializes in blended frozen fruit bowls, topped with fresh fruit, granola and other super-food add-ins. We don't add ice so the consistency is thick and smooth. (Like a smoothie in a bowl with toppings). Our focus is serving whole, healthy, great tasting food. Fresche is a place that your body can trust, and your taste buds will demand. Fresche acai bowls are lower in sugar, dairy free, with gluten free options.

Vegan, Vegetarian, Paleo and Diabetic friendly. Just let us know what your preference is.   

Fresche matches up well with the growing trend of consumers who are demanding truly healthy food options. Many restaurants claim to have healthy menu items, when in reality they are not.  Thrive! is a place that leaves you feeling good about what you have fueled your body with.  

If you are looking for acai bowls in Tempe, Mesa, Scottsdale or Phoenix, it is worth the drive!

With over 450 franchised units throughout the United States and in seven countries, Maui Wowi is a leader in non-traditional venues such as sports stadiums, arenas, racetracks and more. From event carts, mall kiosks, and stand-alone retail locations, there is a business model to fit any lifestyle. 

The smoothies are all-natural, gluten free, fat-free, and kosher certified; made using premium quality ingredients and freshly blended. Our coffees come from the premier coffee growing region on the Hawaiian Islands, including the Kona District of the Big Island of Hawaii. They are roasted fresh and brewed to perfection!

On one hand, we can boast the superior quality and dedication to  research and development on all levels of our company, and on the other,  we cannot provide our clients with excuses as to where there  potentially be defects or inconsistencies in our product. We are our own  manufactures.

Throughout  the year, we scour each unique region to select Italy’s best products.  This is in valuable addition to what we cultivate at our estate in  Bolgheri, Tuscany.
For each Sogno Toscano product, we perform rigorous laboratory  testing, sampling, and tasting by aware winning chefs. We develop the  spec sheets, packaging, and lot selection as well as monitor the  loading, withdrawal, and container closure with our safety seal.
